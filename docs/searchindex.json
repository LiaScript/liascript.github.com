Our map is based on the OpenStreetMap and uses the Leaflet library to display the markers.\nvisit the world-map All information about the projects is stored within a static YAML-file:\nhttps://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com/world-map/projects.yml If you want to add your project to this map, the easiest way is to send us an email with the following information, or leave a comment:\n- title: \u0026#34;Your Project Title\u0026#34; link: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-project.web\u0026#34; gps: latitude: 51.330 longitude: 10.453 image: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-image.jpg\u0026#34; icon: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-organization-icon.png\u0026#34; description: | This can be a description of your project where you can also embed HTML, with more links or contact information \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;mailto:LiaScript@web.de\u0026gt;Send us an email\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; categories: - Computer Science - Statistics - Machine Learning tags: - Need Help - Looking for Contributors - German We will add your information to projects.yml and update the map.\nThe only information that is mandatory is the title, link, and gps. The image is optional, but it will make your project more visible. The description can be a short text or a long description, and you can also embed HTML, like links or images. The categories and tags are optional too, but they will help to filter the projects later on the map. And finally, the icon is optional, and we will later use this to modify the markers on the map, which can be a logo of your institution, project, or company.\nOtherwise you can also fork the repository https://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com, add your project by yourself and create a pull request. This way you will also be visible in the list of contributors on GitHub 😉\nIf you host your project on GitHub you can also take a look at the following post to increase its visibility:\nPromoting your Content If you want to \u0026ldquo;promote\u0026rdquo; the LiaScript content you have created, or share it with a wider audience, then you can use the following methods. Preview Changes If you have forked the repository, you can also preview your changes locally. At first follow the installation instruction as described in the README.md of the repository. Then run the following commands in the root directory of the repository:\ncd world-map python3 generate.py cd .. npm run dev The python command will generate the content/english/pages/world-map.md file. You can preview the changes by opening the browser and navigating to:\nhttp://localhost:1313/world-map/ Credits \u0026amp; Stand with Ukraine As aforementioned, the map the Leaflet library, which was developed by Volodymyr Agafonkin a Ukrainian developer still living in Kiev.

Additionally, scripts can be stiched together by an execution graph, which is defined by the output of the script-tags. The script is executed in the browser and can be used to manipulate the image in real-time.\nFor more information of how to use script-tags, visit the documentation:\nJavaScript or JS-Components Example "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/importing-a-local-camera-stream-into-a-presentation/","title":"Importing a local WebCam-stream into a Presentation","description":"How to use script-tags to create image-filtering effects in LiaScript.","date":"February 2, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/webcam_huf1e9b2980660240b05c3fdc92966cee9_750214_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/webcam_huf1e9b2980660240b05c3fdc92966cee9_750214_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_2.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/webcam_huf1e9b2980660240b05c3fdc92966cee9_750214_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/webcam_huf1e9b2980660240b05c3fdc92966cee9_750214_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_2.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Examples","tags":"LiaScript, JavaScript, Feature","content":"Sometimes you want to show a live video stream from a local WebCam in your presentation, without having to move to another application. This can be done with the following script and video-tag. It will ask for permission to access the camera and will display the video stream in a video element. If you click on the button again, the camera will be closed.\nSimply copy both tags into your LiaScript document and you will be able to open and close the camera stream with the button.\nHow does it work? The video-tag is the place for your video, it could be placed also below the script tag. The script tag will search for the video element and will try to access the camera stream. If the camera is not available, it will output an error message. If the camera is available, it will display the video stream within the video tag and switch its display style form none to block and change the button text to \u0026ldquo;Close Camera\u0026rdquo;. If you click on the button again, the camera will be closed. By using type submit as input, the button will be displayed as a submit button, which will trigger the script execution only if the button is clicked.\nAdditionally in order to have persistent slide, the persistent: true tag is used, which will keep the state of the video element and the camera stream, even if you switch to another slide and come back. If this is not defined, you will have to click onto the button again when you revisit the slide, to open the camera stream.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-user-symposium-recording/","title":"Liascript User Symposium (Recording)","description":"Discover WHO is utilizing and creating free, open online courses using the user-friendly LiaScript Markdown and WHY.

We argued that central server reliance is outdated, and advocating for the innovative use of web browsers as operating systems to access content and decentralized resources.\nInteractive Content Creation: Participants used LiaScript to create interactive educational content in small groups, by using the LiveEditor . In contrast to other \u0026ldquo;Markdown\u0026rdquo;-editors (e.g., CodiMD , HedgeDoc ), this presents an entirely browser-based solution that does not require a centralized server for storing content and collaborative editing.\nServerless Storage: Various serverless technologies were introduced, including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for offline content access, LiaScript and its LiveEditor as two PWA examples, and methods for content storage and sharing like URL encoding, the InterPlanetry File System IPFS, WebTorrent , and OnionShare for sharing content via the Tor-Network.\nDecentralized Communication: The workshop involved interactive sessions in virtual classrooms utilizing decentralized communication methods, showcasing alternatives to traditional, server-reliant methods. The basics of WebRTC were explained for creating browser-based peer-to-peer networks. Additionally, the concept of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) was discussed for achieving consistency in peer-to-peer networks without central servers.\nClassrooms: The use of these technologies in creating serverless classrooms in LiaScript was demonstrated, which allows to instantly connect users without the need for a login, authentification. A classroom is only established beween users, no state is stored or logged\nRemote Labs: Finally we demonstrated that these tecnologies can also be used for sharing remote labs. Edrys(-Lite) was used to share the setup of a laboratory with Arduino hardware, all through the browser\u0026hellip;\nSession Takeaways: Participants gained insights into modern browser capabilities for communication and collaboration, learned methods to share content serverlessly, and began to critically evaluate centralized platforms in terms of cost, sustainability, and functionality.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-workshop-auf-der-delfi-tagung-in-aachen/","title":"Konzepte und Erfahrungen bei der Realisierung dezentraler, offener Lehrmaterialien mit LiaScript (German)","description":"Dies ist ein Mitschnitt des Workshops, der auf auf der DELFI-Tagung 2023 in Aachen gegeben wurde.","date":"November 19, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/delfi23_hu5d1cc1cda8a0f6e380bde8a18a02d3cc_83763_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"238\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/delfi23_hu5d1cc1cda8a0f6e380bde8a18a02d3cc_83763_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/delfi23_hu5d1cc1cda8a0f6e380bde8a18a02d3cc_83763_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/delfi23_hu5d1cc1cda8a0f6e380bde8a18a02d3cc_83763_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Tutorial, Conference, Talk","tags":"LiaScript, Workshop, YouTube","content":"Dies ist ein Mitschnitt des Workshops, der auf auf der DELFI-Tagung 2023 in Aachen gegeben wurde.\nhttps://delfi-tagung.de/delfi-2023/workshops-tutorials LiaScript implementiert als Markdown-basierte Beschreibungssprache für Lehrinhalte die zentralen Konzepte von Open Educational Ressources.

Teilnehmende, bekannt als Fellows, implementieren innovative Projekte in verschiedenen Fachbereichen, um die digitale Bildung zu stärken. Sie arbeiten an Themen wie der Verbesserung von Lehrkompetenzen mittels Technologie, der Entwicklung von multimedialen Lernmodulen und der Förderung digitaler Kompetenzen. Ziel ist es, flexible Lernprozesse zu unterstützen und die Hochschullehre durch den Einsatz digitaler Tools zu bereichern.\nIn Freiberg wurden von Dr. Marc Jacob LiaScript bei der Erstellung von OER-Materialien für die Vermittlung von Fremdsprachlichen Präsentationstechniken eingesetzt. Im Kurs \u0026ldquo;Einführung in die Fachsprache Englisch für Informatiker\u0026rdquo; wird ein online-Angebot für wissenschaftliches Präsentieren als Blended-Learning erstellt. Die Studierenden werden mit Hilfe von online-Materialien und videobasierten Inhalten verschiedenen Präsentationstechniken kennen lernen und im Rahmen der Gruppenarbeit auf Basis der fachlichen Fragestellungen aus dem Informatikunterricht trainieren. Dabei werden die Studierenden durch ein digitales Peer-to-Peer Verfahren über verschiedene Präsentationsfehler (Anhang von Videobeispielen) reflektieren, und das Präsentieren am Beispiel von Informatikthemen (z.B. Softwareentwicklungbezogene Diagrammen, Softwaremetriken, Faulty code fragements usw.) mit Beachtung von wissenschaftlichen Regeln üben.\nHier geht\u0026#39;s zum Projekt In ihrem Fellowship geben Dr. Marc Jacob und Prof. Sebastian Zug einen Einblick in die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten zur Nutzung von OER in Lehrveranstaltungen.

This workshop will demonstrate how LiaScript can be used to create sustainable and extendable open educational resources (OER) that are interactive, engaging, and even work offline. In contrast to complex user-interfaces and memorising lots of point and click events, participants will work with simple text-files only.\nLiaScript is based on Markdown, which is founded on ideas around simplicity, adaptability and extendibility. Visual and textual metaphors are used instead of coding to define quizzes, surveys, presentations, animations, and text-to-speech output. Courses created with LiaScript can be presented as a fully interactive textbook, a presentation or YouTube-like screencast format. Participants will learn the basics of Markdown for publishing and the general LiaScript idea. This includes exploring how to create animations, content in different languages, different styles of quizzes and surveys, integrate multimedia content, automated data-visualization and interactive programming. You will be introduced to the basics of version-management and open-source to enable you to publish your course immediately through GitHub. Finally, you will learn how to create class-rooms and how to export your content into an SCORM or IMS packages. This will enable uploads to most Learning Management Systems (LMS), or translated to Android, IOS, Windows applications, and standalone Web-projects.\nPrerequisite Knowledge: Your own laptop is required, previous knowledge of how to edit a text-file is useful in creating an interactive learning experience.\nExpected Outcomes: Learn how to create completely interactive and free online courses with LiaScript/Markdown. You will be introduced to the basics of git/GitHub (a version management system), which enables multi-authorship, versioning (in different languages), and free hosting of courses.

Roughly the same amount of species occasionally enters as vagrants from the the North Sea or via discharging rivers. The FISHIDENTIFIER allows easy determination of all these species. Clicking to one character, e.g. ‘three dorsal fins’, will limit the results to the respective species. Clicking additional characters further restricts the amount of possible results.\nThis version of the Fischbestimmer is stored in the following repository:\nhttps://github.com/andre-dietrich/Fischbestimmer "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/open-science-festival-2022/","title":"Online-Lehre offen gestalten - Einführung in die Software LiaScript (Open Science Festival 2022)","description":"In zwei informativen und komprimierten Videos zeigen Lennart Rosseburg und Twillo wie man mit LiaScript effizient Online-Kurse erstellt.","date":"August 30, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/open-science-festival-2022_hu406a4a562f0953a61e069ad650f18b8a_314340_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"257\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/open-science-festival-2022_hu406a4a562f0953a61e069ad650f18b8a_314340_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/open-science-festival-2022_hu406a4a562f0953a61e069ad650f18b8a_314340_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/open-science-festival-2022_hu406a4a562f0953a61e069ad650f18b8a_314340_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Community, Tutorial","tags":"LiaScript, Twillo, OER, Tutorial","content":"Unter dem folgenden Link findet ihr die Materialien des Workshops \u0026ldquo;Online-Lehre offen gestalten - Einführung in die Software Liascript\u0026rdquo; von twillo. Gehalten auf dem Open Science Festival am 30. und 31. August 2022 in der Leibniz Universität Hannover.\nHier geht\u0026#39;s zu den Materialien Inhalt Open Educational Resources (OER) sind frei zugängliche Bildungsmaterialien, die eine Anpassung an spezifische Lehr-/Lernkontexte ermöglichen und die Gestaltung von Bildungsangeboten vereinfachen. Die Erstellung und das Teilen von OER bietet die Möglichkeit, die eigene Lehre in der wissenschaftlichen Community sichtbar zu machen. Darüber hinaus tragen OER zu einem offenen Zugang zu Bildung bei und fördern die Entwicklung einer offenen Lehr- und Lernkultur.\nFür die Veröffentlichung interaktiver Kurse oder Lektionen als OER eignet sich LiaScript - eine Erweiterung der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown, die explizit auf die Erstellung frei zugänglicher digitaler Lernmaterialien ausgelegt ist. Die Nutzung der Open-Source (OS) Software ist kostenlos möglich - für die Erstellung eigener Kurse wird lediglich ein Browser oder Texteditor benötigt. Erstellte Lernmaterialien sind einfache Textdateien, die ähnlich wie bei OS-Projekten von jedermann über GitHub gehostet werden können. Dies vereinfacht die gemeinschaftliche Bearbeitung von Materalien - inkl. nachvollziehbarer Versionierung - und bietet exzellente Nachnutzbarkeit. LiaScript ist nicht nur für Erstellung von OER geeignet, die Software zielt sogar explizit darauf. Die Grundidee ist es, einen Beitrag zur Gestaltung von offener und kollaborativer Bildung zu leisten - international und über alle Bildungsbereiche.\nIm Workshop wurden eingangs kurz die zentralen Merkmale von OER vorgestellt. Anschließend lernten die Teilnehmer:innen die wichtigsten LiaScript-Funktionen sowie die Basics der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown kennen und erprobten diese bei der Erstellung einer eigenen Kursdatei.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/how-to-code-in-python-3/","title":"How To Code in Python 3","description":"DigitalOcean’s How To Code in Python 3 tutorial series translated to LiaScript with interactive PyScript examples.","date":"July 8, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/python3_hu3c231f1ce57cf45dd8601e74a302291f_267391_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"216\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/python3_hu3c231f1ce57cf45dd8601e74a302291f_267391_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/python3_hu3c231f1ce57cf45dd8601e74a302291f_267391_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/python3_hu3c231f1ce57cf45dd8601e74a302291f_267391_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Examples","tags":"LiaScript, Books, Coding","content":"This is a port of DigitalOcean’s How To Code in Python 3 tutorial series by Lisa Tagliaferri translated to LiaScript with interactive PyScript examples.\nStart Course This example uses the PyScript template which implements some basic macros for integrating the PyScript into LiaScript and to make Markdown code-blocks executable.\nThe GitHub repository for this project can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaBooks/How-To-Code-in-Python-3 \u0026hellip; or try it out in the LiveEditor :\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/promoting-your-content/","title":"Promoting your Content","description":"How to promote your LiaScript content and make it more visible to a wider audience.

If you have not installed Atom so far, check out our blog-post on Install Atom with LiaScript . It will guide you through the installation procedure for Atom and the two LiaScript plugins and tell you something about the navigation within a document. However, there exist a couple of other plugins for Atom that are very handy and simplify the writing process for Markdown and of course LiaScript Whether you are using Atom or VSCode as your main editor, the main keystrokes you have to remember are Ctrl-S to save the current document you are in, and the other one is Ctrl-Shift-P to get into a fuzzy search over all possible options.\nspell-check This module is already installed by default, but for some reason, we had to enable it first for Markdown. You can either hit Ctrl+, and the settings-view will open immediately, or you can use the magic keystroke Ctrl-Shift-P to get to the fuzzy search and type settings. After that, hit enter and in both cases, you should be presented with a view similar to one displayed in the image below:\nClick onto the Packages-tab on the left, which lists all the installed packages and type spell-check into the main input field, or simply scroll down your list until you find it. Then click onto the settings-button for the spell-check plugin and append , text.md to the default list of grammar file types. Doing so, we tell Atom to apply this plugin onto all of our Markdown files. Last but not least, you can also specify the language to check within the Locals settings. In our case, this was en-US, but any other language shortcut (IETF-language-tag) is also possible. You will have to restart Atom .\nHowever, this plugin will only use the system internal spell-checker. If spell-checking is not working for some reason, you might have to install it manually. Please follow the instructions of the package maintainers, which can be found here .\nminimap Minimap gives you a nice overview on your documents, as depicted below. This comes handy when you need to scroll through a larger document. Minimap will show you your position within the file, and you can click onto your minimap to navigate within your document.\nTo install minimap, go to the settings via Ctrl+, or hit Ctrl-Shift-P and type settings info the fuzzy search. Within the settings-view you will have to click onto the install-tab and type minimap into the search. Do not directly install the first plugin, but search for the one whose title is exactly minimap and then click on install. That\u0026rsquo;s it, now you will be presented with a nice little map of your documents on the right.\nFor more information, see the project-page .\nlanguage-markdown Although syntax-highlighting for Markdown files should already work, you can install the language-markdown package too. The procedure is the same as for minimap, but this time you have to search for language-markdown instead. This will add additional grammar support for Markdown (including Github flavored, AtomDoc, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, YAML/TOML front-matter, and R Markdown), and smart context-aware behavior to lists, and keyboard shortcuts for inline emphasis. As shown in the demonstration below, this will automatically add new bullet-points for you, or by selecting a word or a phrase and then typing *, _, `, etc. it will automatically add these annotations to your selection.\nMore information can be found here .\nmarkdown-table-editor This is one of the most beautiful packages and a need for everyone who writes Markdown. It will automatically format tables, add spaces, cells, and rows for you. No need to manually hit spaces anymore. For jumping from cell to cell, simply use the Tab key.\nHave a look at the project-website for a detailed description of all features.\nautocomplete-emojis After installing this plugin, you will never have to search for a unicode-icon or emoji again. Only type colon and search for the icon that you want to insert. In LiaScript you can add emojis everywhere, in titles, and even in ASCII-Art images.\nProject-website autocomplete-math This is not only useful for Markdown. Simply write between parenthesis your mathematical formula and this plugin will perform the calculation for you. It is based on Math.js and can do more than simple calculations.\nIt is not only possible to convert between different entities, but also to make calculation with different ones. Thereby the first entity defines the result, others will be translated into this first one.\n(12cm to inch) --\u0026gt; 4.72440944882 inch (12days + 3months) --\u0026gt; 103.3125 days (3months + 12days) --\u0026gt; 3.39425051335 months (sin(45 deg) ^ 2) --\u0026gt; 0.5 Package-website LiaScript As mentioned in the blog post Install Atom with LiaScript , it is for us and some others at the moment not possible to update our packages. Thus, the LiaScript snippets and preview plugins have to be installed from GitHub . The procedure to install these two packages is similar to the installation of the previews packages. Go to the settings, select the install tab and instead of typing liascript-snippets or liascript-preview into the search field, you have to mention the GitHub repository first. In our case, these two projects are in:\nhttps://github.com/andre-dietrich That is why you have to insert andre-dietrich/liascript-snippets and andre-dietrich/liascript-preview to install them directly from:\nhttps://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-snippets https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview liascript-snippets To activate the snippets, go to a Markdown file and type lia all snippets are associated with this starting phrase. You can create a base stub for your course by typing liainit and then hitting enter. But, you can also search for quizzes, code snippets, etc. simply by typing lia and then searching or scrolling through the options. All snippets come with a little explanation and some examples.\nThere are two additional key-phrases, one is voice and the other one is hili, which stands for highlight-language. The first voice-phrase can be used to search through all supported voices for the text-to-speech output, currently we rely on responsivevoice to support the same quality of spoken text on all browsers. hili allows you to search through all supported languages for code-snippets (e.g., cpp, java, javascript, python, \u0026hellip;).\nliascript-preview You can either hit Ctrl-Shift-P and then type liascript into the fuzzy search to see all options for this plugin. In most cases, you want to toggle the preview for your course, that is why you also can use the short-cut Alt-L, which will either open or close the preview-pane. Whenever you make changes to your document and save them, the preview will be reloaded. Use the short-cut Ctrl-S to save your document, this is a standard and works also in Word. To navigate through your document, you can use double-clicks. If you double-click on a word within the editor, the slide for this element will be opened with the preview. If you double-click onto an element within the preview, then the cursor will jump to the respective line within the editor.\nFor more keyboard short-cuts, hit [Ctrl+Shift+P] or visit the project website .\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/imprt-a-frame-3d-models-scenes-and-more-into-liascript/","title":"Import A-Frame 3D models, scenes, and more into LiaScript open-courSes","description":"This blog entry presents an example of how to import A-Frame 3D models, scenes, and more into LiaScript open-courSes.","date":"May 18, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003cimg\n    loading=\"\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/A-Frame_Hello_World_example.png/800px-A-Frame_Hello_World_example.png\"\n    alt=\"\"\n    class=\" img\"\n    height=\"\"\n    width=\"420\" /\u003e\n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003cimg\n    loading=\"\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/A-Frame_Hello_World_example.png/800px-A-Frame_Hello_World_example.png\"\n    alt=\"\"\n    class=\" img\"\n    height=\"100\"\n    width=\"100\" /\u003e\n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Examples","tags":"LiaScript, 3D, Feature, Template, YouTube","content":"This blog entry presents an example of how to import A-Frame 3D models, scenes, and more into LiaScript open-courSes.\nThe entire README file can be interpreted as a library, we say template, that only needs to be imported into your LiaScript course via:\n\u0026lt;!-- import: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/aframe/master/README.md --\u0026gt; # Your Course And then you can start to use all the features and examples that are provided in the original README file.\nThe idea of a template is to provide a fully functional course that also works as documentation for the implemented functionality/macros.

Together with the lecturers, the students work on the lecture materials with open tools via a website - without any PDF documents or PowerPoint slide collections.\nProf. Sebastian Zug during his lecture. Photo: TU Bergakademie Freiberg\nWith one click, students can display the content in different languages, develop an executable program code or start simulations. Despite the diverse content, they also have the opportunity to suggest adjustments and additions. “We continue to develop the open learning content together with the students over the course of the semester. At the end there is a revised version of the lecture materials for each semester, some of which was developed by 15 co-authors,” explains Prof. Sebastian Zug. He is certain: “If it is no longer exclusively the teachers who determine how knowledge is conveyed, this will contribute to transparency. And: Students deal with the subject matter more critically. That also works in non-computer science courses.”\nIntroduce improvements and additions to the lecture The basis for this is an easy-to-read description language - LiaScript - which takes up the concepts of Markdown. The latter is also used in text messages such as WhatsApp when content is to be displayed in bold, italics or underlined. “Combined with plugins that embed the interactive content, educators can create attractive materials using just the text editor. Stored in a cloud or another online storage location, the LiaScript website then accesses the text files directly from the browser and creates an interactive online course live from them,\u0026quot; explains Dr. André Dietrich, who developed LiaScript. This creates a “code” for the course. This is shared and disseminated and can then be adapted in terms of content by each teacher to their didactic goals using open tools. “In the computer science lectures at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, we go one step further and involve the students in this process. I am convinced that the quality of the materials used, which were discussed and assessed by a community of teachers and students, increases in favor of the students,\u0026quot; says Dr. Dietrich further.\nThe team is currently working on interfaces for better embedding of LiaScript in various learning management platforms. \u0026ldquo;While lecturers here in Freiberg conduct online lectures on the OPAL platform, other universities use Moodle or ILIAS, for example,\u0026rdquo; explains Prof. Zug. \u0026ldquo;We have therefore been working with LiaScript as open software since 2017 to enable comprehensive use.\u0026rdquo; A study on user-friendliness was also carried out so that teachers without programming knowledge can quickly familiarize themselves with it. Based on this, an adapted online editor was created, which can be used for the first cooperative practical tests under LiaScript. \u0026ldquo;This is now used not only by interdisciplinary facilities and institutes at our university, but also by German universities and a growing international community,\u0026rdquo; says Prof. Zug happily.\nBackground: Open Educational Resources in the e-learning portfolio The term Open Educational Resources (OER) was coined by UNESCO 20 years ago and means materials that are made freely available to everyone, both for learning and for modification, without incurring any license or usage costs. In addition to simple texts as a PDF or Word document, this can also be instructional videos or audios, prepared teaching material, photos or graphics.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-tutorial-freiberg/","title":"LiaScript Tutorial an der TU Bergakademie Freiberg (German)","description":"In diesem Tutorial werden die neusten Features und das &#34;neue&#34; Design von LiaScript vorgestellt.

If you prefix a link in Markdown with an exclamation mark, then this link is marked as an image, and it gets embedded into the document. LiaScript had already two extensions for this, the question-mark is used to indicate audio (just think of an ear) and images with sound which are used as markers for video content.\n![image](url) ?[audio](url) !?[video](url) One benefit of using this notation is, that this does not interfere with Markdown, the link is still valid and \u0026ldquo;clickable\u0026rdquo; in any other Markdown-viewer. This works pretty well, but from time to time it would be great if it would also be possible to embed different kind of external resources or entire websites, which cannot be associated to audio or video content.\nIn LiaScript we had extended the link annotation for two question-marks, which means: \u0026ldquo;I have no idea, please try to embed this content\u0026rdquo;. As shown in the demo below, this is treated like any other multimedia-link, and it can be used to create galleries as well.\nTo accomplish this, we currently use two different strategies:\noEmbed IFrames 1. oEmbed oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.\nThis functionality is embedded as a standalone web component and can be found here . It basically goes like this: If an only if the provided URL matches one of the websites that provide an oEmbed-service, then this service is queried at first. The parameters send are the URL and the size of the screen. This can be seen as a simple question, where the LiaScript-interpreter asks: \u0026ldquo;What is the best way to embed this source\u0026rdquo; and the service-provider responds with an JSON that looks similar to the following one:\n{ \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;photo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: 240, \u0026#34;height\u0026#34;: 160, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ZB8T0193\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2341623661_7c99f48bbf_m.jpg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bees\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bees/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;provider_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Flickr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;provider_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.flickr.com/\u0026#34; } The response contains either a URL that can be directly embedded, or it will respond with an \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; field that contains the required HTML tags to embed this content. Additionally, we use the thumbnails provided by this service within the gallery-view.\nIf there is no service-provider for the given URL, then LiaScript will try to embed the content as an IFrame.\n2. IFrames An IFrame is an HTML-tag that allows to embed other websites into the current site. This is also what you do, when you try to embed, for example, a YouTube-video manually. This embed-code is mostly an IFrame too. However, some sites might protect their content and will not allow embedding their content into the content of another website with another URL, which is known as CORS . Thus, you will have to check if your content will be embedded into LiaScript, if you are using a local editor or the dev-server to preview your course, this might work well, since most browsers ignore CORS on localhost. But, if your content is loaded from a website, this might not be the case anymore ;-)\noEmbed Service-Providers date: 24/05/2022\n# Provider Name URL 0 23HQ https://www.23hq.com 1 Abraia

Wikipedia describes it as follows:\nOpen educational resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes\u0026hellip;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources Thus, the ER defines any kind of Educational¹ content while the O points to an open licensing format. But the idea is actually not new at all, there have been attempts that predate the OER movement by nearly a century.\nIn 1923 the French pedagogue and educational reformer Celestine Freinet purchased a printing press and started to print his educational work and those of his pupils. These free texts were later published in class newspapers, discussed within the classroom and shared with other schools, changed, reprinted, etc. By the time these texts started to replace their conventional school books and in 1926 Freinet had developed a press for schools, that can still be bought today (cf. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuldruckerei) .\nIf we look on what has been achieved, it practically not much. Although, accessing, sharing and copying of information has never been easier, due to Computers and the Internet. But, we are still restricting ourselves. One limitation is caused by the application of restrictive licenses, which is tackled by the idea of openness in ER. But could the openness also be interpreted in much broader sense?\nEditable² The term open should also cover the format of the educational resource. Next to an open license that allows to change and redistribute the content, the second E in OEER could stand for editable or in other words modifiable. In the world of Freinet this would mean, that next to the class newspapers also the frames that contain the letters are exchanged. Obviously, this does not make sense, but sharing only a static PDF is of similar quality. It can hardly be modified after it has been created from a Word-, LaTeX-, PowerPoint-, Impress-, or any other kind of document.\nOf course, some might argue, that it is still possible to alter the content of a PDF-file and it should therefor also be interpreted as editable. But, it is not possible to rearrange the content, while keeping all internal references and the format in sync. In the same way you could say every executable program is also free for edit, since it can be disassembled or decompiled in order to produce a format that can be modified again by humans. To cut a long story short, this does not produce any valuable result, especially if the project is way too complex.\nSo why do we not share the editable part in the first place. Everyone can use it, adapt, correct, translate it and also push his/her changes back into the original resource. This is not a hard problem at all, instead software-developers do this all the time. This can be applied to any format: text/audio/video/code.\nTo close this part, we should prefer directly editable formats (such as Word over PDF) and free formats over commercial (Writer over Word), and to go a step human-readable formats that do not require any kind of specialized software for editing (Markdown over Writer), but can be read and edited by everyone with a simple text editor, if possible.\nSide Note: Storing and hosting editable educational content on GitHub has the benefit of permanence. The Archive Program is an initiative that wants to preserve the human knowledge, including open-source projects, for the next 1000 years. To achieve this, projects are stored at different places in the world, including data-centers in Antarctica.\nhttps://archiveprogram.github.com Executable³ Isn\u0026rsquo;t it strange, that most of the digital educational content resembles printed matter: PDFs, Word, websites, etc.? Of course, there is also the development from blackboard -\u0026gt; over overhead transparencies -\u0026gt; to PowerPoint and of course multimedia, BUT, and this is a BUT in capital letters, if we are talking about computers as the main medium for presenting educational content, this content should also be Executable³ and this is where the third E in OEEER comes in. Content is much more graspable, if you can interact with it:\nchange the parameters of a function and visualize the result, dive into a simulation on astronomy, make physical measurements and experiment with the sensory system on your smartphone, use quizzes to check the understanding of a certain topic immediately learn to program through directly editing code and executing it or learn to analyze medical data (scans) through direct interaction \u0026hellip; Bret Victor provides on his website http://worrydream.com an incredible resource for inspiration, ideas, and examples:\nhttp://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable He also coins the terms “model-driven debate” and “model-driven reading” and demonstrates how just some small interactive elements within a static text can be used to improve the understanding of a certain topic, which would be otherwise hard to digest.\nhttp://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#media-debate Why is it, that nearly no one makes calculations an interactive part of her/his publication?\nTo simplify this process, JavaScript is now an essential/native part of LiaScript. Snippets can be added everywhere within the text, table, enumeration, etc. and perform some calculations, query the internet, trigger an action, or do something else. The calculation result becomes part of the presented document. Furthermore, scripts can be interconnected like in an Excel-sheet, so that a change in one cell/script triggers a recalculation of the associated cells/scripts. The user can interact with every script, inspect it, and even modify its code.\nLiaScript integration of interactive script elements\nFor non-trivial and reoccurring tasks, LiaScript provides the concept of reusable and parameterizable macros, and template-courses. Thus, the functionality that is defined within one LiaScript document can be imported into other documents, so that the course creator does not have to be a programmer to add various kinds of interactions or simulations\u0026hellip;\nSide Note: When we talk about the lack of code or interactive analyzes, we also have to admit the lack of primary data. Primary or raw data is mostly not stored and accessible directly, but hidden behind processed data (e.g., median, average) as well as figures and diagrams. Projects like the Open-Science-Framework are intended to be used as a reservoir for primary data, code for all analyzes, and documentation. This way, the data and measurements are not lost, but can also be later reused by others.\nhttps://osf.io Summary The next generation of OER will be modifiable and interactive or in order to stick to the triple-E notation: Editable and Executable. But, although many enthusiasts already think of integrating artificial intelligence (AI), to utilize modern technologies such as virtual- or augmented reality (VR/AR), or to apply gamification in education, content is still the hardest part. A well written text, an informative image, a short video demonstration, and a good didactic concept will still provide the foundation\u0026hellip;\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-cheet-sheet/","title":"LiaScript Cheet-Sheet (German)","description":"Ein Spickzettel der wichtigsten LiaScript-Funktionalität.

The names can be taken from the previous titles, it is not relevant if you use lower or upper-case. This way it is also possible to use types that cannot be automatically infered at the moment, such as Sankey or BoxPlot.\nIf you do not want to show tables as diagrams, you can also use data-type=\u0026quot;None\u0026quot; and only the table will be visible.\ndata-show: Simply add this attribute or set it to true (data-show=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;), if you want to visualize your data immediately, without the need to click in the switch-button. It is still possible for your users to switch to the table representation.\ndata-transpose: Like in the mathematical sense, set this attribute or set it to true (data-transpose=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;), if you want to switch rows and columns. One benefit is, that you can for example use PieChart and let your table grow vertically instead of using a horizontal monster.\ndata-title: Normaly, the first cell defines the title of your diagram, but if you want larger titles and not have to write gigantic table headers, apply this attribute data-title=\u0026quot;Use whatever title you want to ...\u0026quot;\ndata-xlabel: As above, you can also define the strings for the labels, in this case for the x label\ndata-ylabel: or the y label.\ndata-src: Currently this attribute is used to refere to your geojson data, if you use the data-type=\u0026quot;Map\u0026quot; representation, but this might change in the future to load and visualize data directly, such as csv.\nIf you are using geojson files from external websites such as:\nhttps://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/ It can be usefull to use anycors, if the data cannot be visualized due to CORS restrictions:\ndata-src=\u0026quot;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/custom/europe.geo.json\u0026quot;\nCode Ein Code-Block wird durch min. 3 aufeinander folgende Back-ticks vom Rest abgetrennt.

If your document is on GitHub, this will not be visible on the rendered Markdown document. This first comment contains any kind of meta information, such as author, email, version, logo, comment, and if you want to, also tags.

[preview-lia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md) [Preview-Lia](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md) If you want to add a preview into your LiaScript course, simply add a Markdown link with the name preview-lia with a URL that is either pointing to the raw Markdown file or to the LiaScript interpreter. It depends on what you want your link should point, if you are using other Markdown tools.\nThe example below, shows an example for the LiaScipt documentation:\nUsing Previews on your Website If you want to make this functionality available on your site, will have to include the preview-lia web component, by adding the script tag, as it is depicted below, to the head of your HTML website. Then it is possible to use the tag \u0026lt;preview-lia\u0026gt; everywhere on your site. Use either the address of the raw document or the reference to the interactive LiaScript course. The application of both tags is equal to their application in Markdown.\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/preview-lia.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;preview-lia src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; \u0026lt;preview-lia src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; If you want your preview to point to another direction and not to LiaScript website, it is also possible to change the goto reference by adding the attribute link to the web component. Add what ever target link you want to point to, either to the GitHub-repository, to the project website or anywhere else.\n\u0026lt;preview-lia link=\u0026#34;https://github.com/liascript/docs\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; Adding this web component to Ghost Go to your ghost blog website, click on \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Code injection in your settings, and add the following script tag to the Site Header field. That\u0026rsquo;s it, now you can add the \u0026lt;preview-lia\u0026gt; tag in all of your posts and pages into the HTML content.\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/preview-lia.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; How does it work? Under the hood, this is a simple web component that grabs the markdown content and parses only the meta information and the first title. Everything happens within the browser at client-side.\nThe web component was originally developed as part of LiaScript, the entire project can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript While the part, that implements the web component can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript/blob/master/src/javascript/webcomponents/preview-lia.js The style of the presented preview will change in the near future, and probably also the parts that will be shown to the audience.

Natürlich könnt ihr auch jeden anderen Editor nutzen, es gibt zurzeit aber nur Erweiterungen für Atom, um das Arbeiten mit Kursen zu erleichtern.\nAtom: https://atom.io liascript-preview: https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview liascript-snippets: https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets Beide Plugins können direkt aus Atom heraus installiert werden:\nÖffnet den Editor Verwendet die Tastenkombination Strg+, um zu den Einstellungen zu gelangen Wählt das Menü + Install aus Tippt \u0026ldquo;liascript\u0026rdquo; in die Suchmaske ein, die ersten beiden Treffer müssten die beiden Plugins sein Klickt bei beiden auf Install #2 Erste Schritte Nutzung der Entwicklungsumgebung für die Kursentwicklung\nDie wichtigsten Tastenkombinationen:\nAtom: Strg+n: Öffnen einer neuen Datei. Strg+s: Sofortiges Speichern der aktuellen Datei, dies aktualisiert auch die Darstellung in der LiaScript-Vorschau. Strg+Shift+p: Öffnet die Fuzzy-Suche, damit könnt ihr nach allen allem suchen, was der Editor hergibt. Tippt einfach mal liascript ein. LiaScript: Alt-l: Öffnet, bzw. schließt die LiaScript-Vorschau. F5: Aktualisiert die Darstellung wie im Browser. Wenn ihr im Textdokument lia eingebt, dann öffnet sich eine Hilfe nur für LiaScript-Kommandos. Hier könnt ihr einfach mal mit den Pfeiltasten nach unten navigieren und euch die verschiedenen Optionen anzeigen lassen. Wenn ihr auf Enter drückt, wird die ausgewählte Option für euch Übernommen. Falls mehrere Punkte bearbeitet werden können, so könnt ihr mit Tab navigieren.\nFür den Anfang gebt einfach lia-init ein und drückt auf Enter. Damit wird ein Beispiel-Dokument erstellt, das schon die wichtigsten Funktionen von LiaScript zeigt.\nPS: Mit Doppel-Klick könnt ihr in eurem Dokument navigieren. Entweder ihr macht einen Doppel-Klick auf das Dokument, dann springt ihr auf die entsprechende Stelle in der Vorschau, oder ihr macht das Gleiche in der Vorschau und spring dann an die passende Stelle im Dokument.\n#3 Markdown die Grundlagen Einführung in Markdown\nWas ist Markdown? Wenn wir alle HTML mit der Schreibmaschine tippen würden, dann hätten wir wohl das Problem, dass den Text im Nachhinein niemand mehr (oder nur mit großen Anstrengungen) lesen kann. Markdown ist dazu eine Alternative, die sich vor allem im Bloggen oder bei der Dokumentation durchgesetzt hat. Kurz gesagt, es ist eine vereinfachte Schreibweise/Strukturierung von Texten, die das Schreiben vereinfachen soll. Markdown muss dann von verschiedenen Interpretern noch in HTML umgewandelt werden oder wie in unserem Fall, in einen interaktiven online-Kurs.\nEine Kurzzusammenfassung von Markdown könnt ihr auch hier finden: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown Und hier geht es zum Wikipedia-Eintrag: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown #4 Multimedia Markdown Links \u0026amp; Bilder, LiaScript Audio \u0026amp; Videos \u0026amp; mehr\nLinks bzw. Verweise werden in Markdown immer mit der folgenden Notation [name](url) beschrieben. In die eckigen Klammern kommt ein Name und in die runden Klammern die URL bzw. Adresse. Für verschiedene Dinge kann diese Notation überall im Dokument genutzt werden:\n[Ein Link zu LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io) Die beiden unteren Links machen das Gleiche in LiaScript und springen im Dokument:\n[Ein relativer Link im Dokument](#12) [Springe zu](#überschrift-mit-leerzeichen) Bilder sind Verweise, die mit einem Ausrufezeichen ! am Anfang markiert werden. Befindet sich ein Bild außerhalb eures Projektes, dann müsst ihr die volle Adresse angeben, sonst reicht der relative Pfad:\n![externes Bild](https://liascript.github.io/img/atom.jpg) ![lokales Bild](bilder/test.jpg) Audio-Inhalte werden in LiaScript mit einem vorangestellten Fragezeichen ? markiert. Man kann das auch als ein Ohr sehen und neben gängigen Audio-Formaten wie mp3, mp4, wav, \u0026hellip; könnt ihr auch direkt euren Soundcloud link einfügen:\n?[audio lokal](audio/brahms.mp3) ?[brahms](https://soundcloud.com/safyeldin/johannes-brahms-hungarian-dance-no-5) Ein Video ist im Grunde nur ein Bild mit Ton, warum dann nicht Bild und Audio kombinieren !?\n!?[video lokal](film.avi) !?[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3RLIirs7o) Und wollt ihr versuchen irgendwas von einer anderen Seite einzubinden und es handelt sich vielleicht nicht um ein Video oder ein Bild, dann versucht im Zweifel zunächst ??\nDamit wird auf OEMBED zurückgegriffen \u0026hellip; vielleicht funktioniert es ja für euch\u0026hellip;\n??[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3RLIirs7o) ??[spreaker](https://www.spreaker.com/user/12421087/elearning-distance-education-adilson-pin) ??[twitter](https://twitter.com/an_dietrich/status/1297964782369341441) ... #5 Etwas andere Tabellen Interaktive Grafiken\nIm Gegensatz zu anderen Systemen, ist es ein Ziel von LiaScript, den Interpreter (sprich die Maschine) so klug zu machen, dass er (sie) versucht zu interpretieren, was sich der Mensch gedacht hat und dies ggf. entsprechend darstellt.\nNun ja, so weit sind wir noch nicht, aber mit Tabellen können wir schon einiges.\nMarkdown-Tabellen können, wenn sie eine entsprechende Struktur haben, auch als Datensätze interpretiert werden. Warum sollte man solche Datensätze nicht direkt visualisieren um sie somit auch explorativ untersuchen zu können? LiaScript beherrscht zurzeit ca. 11 verschiedene Darstellungen, dazu zählen (LinePlot, ScatterPlot, BoxPlot, BarChart, Radar, PieChart/Torten-Diagramme, Map/Karten, HeatMap, Parallel, Graph (gerichtet und ungerichtet), Sankey). Der Interpreter versucht selbständig zu ermitteln, welche Darstellung am besten zu euren Daten passt. Ihr könnt aber auch selber definieren, wie die Daten dargestellt werden sollen. Für mehr Information klickt auf den folgenden link:\nLink zu LiaScript Diagrammen #6 Publizieren auf GitHub Veröffentlichen und kollaboratives Editieren auf GitHub\nWas im Video etwas schwierig aussah, ist in Wirklichkeit ziemlich einfach. Ihr könnt mittlerweile nicht nur auf GitHub eure Kurse ablegen, sondern auch in eurer Dropbox , GitLab , oder ownCloud eure Kurse hosten.\nDer Vorteil von Versions-Management-Systemen wie GitHub oder GitLab ist, dass ihr auf jede Version eures Kurses zugreifen könnt. Wenn ihr das nicht benötigt, dann steht euch natürlich frei, eure Daten dort zu speichern, wo ihr wollt. Wir speichern keine Inhalte oder Kurse, die LiaScript-Webseite stellt einfach nur den Vermittler oder besser gesagt Reader zur Verfügung. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger, alles wird beim Nutzer im Browser interpretiert und gespeichert.\nIrgendwie muss man auf euer Dokument zugreifen können, sprich es herunterladen können. In der Dropbox müsst ihr euer Dokument veröffentlichen und erhalten dann einen Link, unter GitHub oder GitLab reicht der Verweis auf das Projekt. Diese Adresse wird einfach als URL-Parameter an die LiaScript-Webseite angehängt, ersetzt xxx.md mit eurem Dokument und öffnet die Seite, bzw. teilt sie mit euren Schülern/Studenten.\nhttps://LiaScript.github.io/course/?https://xxx.md #7 Quiz-Time Verschieden Arten von Quizzen in LiaScript\nKleine Quizze sollen dem Lernenden die Möglichkeit geben, schnell zu überprüfen, ob er das gerade eben erfahrene auch verstanden hat.\nLiaScript unterstützt zurzeit 6 verschiedene Arten von Quizzen, die alle noch weiter angepasst werden können. Allen gemein ist die Nutzung von doppelten, zumeist eckigen Klammern.\nEinfache Text-Eingaben:\nFrage und ??? [[Antwort]] Single-Choice-Aufgaben: Es können beliebig viele Auswahlmöglichkeiten angehängt werden. Hier werden eckige Klammern mit runden kombiniert. Das erinnert etwas an Radio-Buttons.\nEine Frage mit mehreren Optionen, aber nur die mit dem X markierte ist richtig [( )] Falsch [(X)] Die einzig richtige Auswahlmöglichkeit [( )] Die ist auch __falsch__ ... Multiple-Choice-Aufgaben: Hier gilt das gleich wie bei Single-Choice-Aufgaben. Die doppelt eckigen Klammern können als Check-Box interpretiert werden.\nEin Frage mit mehreren Optionen und mehreren auszuwählenden Optionen [[ ]] Wie zuvor [[X]] X muss ausgewählt werden [[ ]] hier könnten auch Bilder kommen [[X]] \u0026lt;-- hier muss auch geklickt werden Matrizen: Die Kombination von beliebig vielen Single- und Multiple-Choice-Aufgaben.\nDer Kopf der Tabelle wird ebenfalls in eckigen Klammern geschrieben, die Optionen sind jetzt aber horizontal dargestellt: [[1] [mehr Optionen ] [:-)]] [[X] [X] [X] ] wie zuvor [( ) (X) ( ) ] hier gibt es auch nur eine Möglichkeit Auswahlmöglichkeiten:\nAlle Möglichkeiten werden durch vertikale Striche `|` voneinander getrennt und die Option in runden Klammern definiert die Lösung: [[ falsch | (__Richtig__) | auch falsch ]] \u0026ldquo;Generic\u0026rdquo; wenn ihr wisst was Ihr tut: Dann könnt ihr auch eigene Quiz-Typen definieren.\nIm angehängten JavaScript-Tag könnt ihr alles machen, was ihr wollt. Wenn das Ergebnis `true` ist, dann gilt das Quiz als gelöst. [[!]] \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // you are free to check anything you want true; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Tipp: Der Einschub von 4 Leerzeichen vor jedem Quiz, lässt andere Markdown-Interpreter dieses Element als Code-Block erkennen, daher es werden keine anderen Formatierungen unternommen oder ggf. der Inhalt unleserlich als Absatz dargestellt. (LiaScript ist das jedoch egal\u0026hellip;)\nWeitere Möglichkeiten:\nHinweise: Diese werden mit [[?]] markiert. Danach kann eine Zeile beliebiges Markdown kommen, welches erst angezeigt wird, wenn der Nutzer auf die Hilfe klickt. Diese können an jede beliebige Quiz-Form angehängt werden.\nWas ergibt 20 + 20 + 2? [[42]] [[?]] Erster Hinweis [[?]] Zweiter Hinweis [[?]] Letzter Hinweis Auflösungen\nWas ergibt 20 + 20 + 2? [[42]] [[?]] Erster Hinweis [[?]] Zweiter Hinweis [[?]] Letzter Hinweis ********************************** Dieser Text wird erst eingeblendet, wenn der Nutzer die richtige Antwort gegeben hat oder auf Auflösen klickt. ********************************** Noch mehr Komplexität gewünscht? Ihr könnt an jedes Quiz ein JavaScript hängen. Der Ausdruck @input durch die jeweilige Eingabe ersetzt.\nTippe Auflösung! [[auflösung]] \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // @input will be replace by the user input let input_string = \u0026#34;@input\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;auflösung\u0026#34; == input_string.trim().toLowerCase(); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Für mehr Informationen schaut euch den Quiz-Abschnitt in der Dokumentation an: Mehr über Quizze #8 Formeln mit KaTeX Formel im Kurs\nFür die Darstellung von Formeln nutzt LiaScript KaTeX, einer auf LaTex basierenden Beschreibung für hübsches Formel-Layout. Auf der Webseite https://katex.org findet ihr viele Hilfen, Beispiele und einen Editor. Zu beachten ist nur, dass Formeln in LiaScript (und auch anderen Markdown-Parsern) in Dollar-Zeichen $ eingeschlossen werden. Einzelne Dollar-Zeichen im Text $ f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3 $ und doppelte für eine größere Formel als Block:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2} =\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} $$ #9 HTML, Markdown und Styling Kombiniere Markdown mit HTML und Styling\nWenn ihr HTML könnt, dann könnt ihr es auch direkt einbinden, falls LiaScript etwas nicht kann. Zu beachten ist hierbei, dass HTML und Markdown kombiniert werden kann. Das bringt viele Vorteile, kann aber auch zu Problemen führen, wenn dies nicht beachtet wird.\nIhr könnt aber euere Markdown-Elemente direkt mit HTML-Attributen und CSS annotieren. Das hört sich etwas kompliziert an und sieht vielleicht auch etwas kompliziert aus, wenn man noch nie HTML geschrieben hat. Es erleichtert aber die Anpassung von Inhalten ungemein, ihr könnt Farben, Animationen, Breiten und vieles mehr anpassen, was sich auch besonders gut bei Bildern macht.\n\u0026lt;!-- style=\u0026#34;color: red\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; Der ganze Block wird rot eingefärbt und nur das ![Bild](https://liascript.github.io/img/atom.jpg)\u0026lt;!-- style=\u0026#34;height: 30px\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; alleine skaliert. Ein HTML-Kommentar wird mit \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt; eingeschlossen. Diese Tags werden von den meisten Interpretern ignoriert und nicht dargestellt, nur LiaScript versucht den Inhalt zu analysieren. Falls der Inhalt wie HTML-Parameter aussehen, dann werden diese auch auf die jeweiligen Elemente angewandt. Ein HTML-Kommentar am Anfang eines Blocks gilt für den gesamten Block während ein angehängter Kommentar nur für das jeweilige Element verwendet wird.\nFür mehr Information schaut euch auch die entsprechenden Seiten in der Dokumentation:\nSiehe Styling HTML und Markdown Mehr Informationen zu HTML: https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/HTML #10 Animationen und Textausgabe PowerPoint war gestern oder \u0026hellip; wie dein Kurs sprechen lernt\nAnimation und Sprachausgaben werden in LiaScript immer mit doppelt geschweiften Klammern assoziiert {{}} oder {}{}.\nWollt Ihr eine Präsentation machen, in der Elemente auftauchen und wieder verschwinden, dann nutzt diese Notation um zu definieren, wann etwas erscheinen bzw. wieder ausgeblendet werden soll:\n{{1-3}} Gesamte Absätze, Tabellen, oder Bilder können mit der oberen Notation markiert werden. Die erste Zahl definiert, wann dieser Text erscheint, die zweite ist optional und sagt, wann dieser Block wieder ausgeblendet werden soll. Wie bei den Kommentaren zuvor, so kann diese Art der Animation auch für kleinere Elemente genutzt werden: Der folgende {2-4}{_wichtige Unterpunkt_} wird als zweites Element eingeblendet und verschwindet wieder bei Punkt 4. Mehr Information zu Animationen und Effekten finden sich hier .\nDas automatische Vorlesen von Inhalten wird mit der vorangestellten --{{}}-- definiert:\n--{{1}}-- Diese Erklärung wird zu Punkt 1 automatisch vorgelesen. --{{2 US English Male}}-- This is an english text, that will be spoken out loud with an US aczent. Für die Sprachausgabe wird https://responsivevoice.org genutzt. Die verschiedenen Sprachen sind hier aufgelistet, bzw. können diese im Editor durch Eingabe von voice auch durchsucht werden.\nFalls ihr einen Sprachkurs mit \u0026ldquo;bedingter\u0026rdquo; Sprachausgabe erzeugen wollt, dann schaut auch mal hier .\n{{|\u0026gt; Deutsch Female}} Ein \u0026#34;|\u0026gt;\u0026#34; im Effekt sorgt dafür, dass der Text nur vorgelesen wird, wenn der Nutzer auch auf den Play-Button klickt. Funktioniert auch {|\u0026gt;}{mit kleinen} Texten. #11 Programmieren in LiaScript Interaktives Programmieren mit dem internen Versions-Management\nWer Markdown beherrscht, der weiß auch das es die Möglichkeit gibt Code-Blöcke einzufügen, die entsprechend der Programmiersprache „eingefärbt“ werden. Warum ist dieser Code eigentlich nie ausführbar und editierbar?\nIn LiaScript ist es möglich jedes kleine Code-Fragment auch ausführbar zu machen, indem – wie bei den Quizzen – ein Script-Tag angehängt wird. Und ebenso, wie bei Quizzen wird der Code an der Stelle \u0026lsquo;@input\u0026rsquo; eingefügt. Somit kann jedes JavaScript-Beispiel auch direkt ausführbar gemacht werden:\n```javascript var s = \u0026#34;JavaScript syntax highlighting\u0026#34;; alert(s); s; ``` \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;@input\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Kompliziertere Projekte können umgesetzt werden, indem mehrere Code-Blöcke direkt aneinander gehängt werden, diese können auch mit einem Namen versehen werden und ein vorangestelltes \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; oder \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; definiert, ob dem Nutzer diese „Datei“ angezeigt werden soll.\n``` js -EvalScript.js let who = data.first_name + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + data.last_name; if(data.online) { who + \u0026#34; is online\u0026#34;; } else { who + \u0026#34; is NOT online\u0026#34;; } ``` ``` json +Data.json { \u0026#34;first_name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Sammy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last_name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Shark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;online\u0026#34; : true } ``` \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data let data = @input(1); // eval the script that uses this dataset eval(`@input(0)`); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Das @input Macro kann auch parametrisiert werden und somit die Inhalte der verschiedenen Dateien auch an der entsprechenden Stelle im JavaScript-Code eingefügt werden.\nZusätzlich dazu können auch Bibliotheken eingebunden werden oder externe Server angefragt werden. Damit lassen sich nach JavaScript auch verschiedene andere Programmiersprachen ausführen.\nMit den Code-Segmenten kann noch viel mehr gemacht werden, siehe dazu den Abschnitt Interactive Code in der Dokumentation.\n#12 ASCII-Art Zeichnen lernen mit der Tastatur im Dokument\nZeichnungen LiaScript unterstützt intern zwei verschiedene Arten von ASCII-Art, dazu können einerseits \u0026lsquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo;,\u0026rsquo;_\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;|\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo; und viele Zeichen mehr genutzt werden, um verschieden Sachverhalte abzubilden. Der Vorteil davon ist, dass man nicht zusätzlich noch ein Zeichenprogramm bemühen muss, um einfache Grafiken zu erstellen, bzw. diese anzupassen und zu verändern. Um das „Bild“ vom Rest des Dokumentes abzugrenzen kann entweder ein normaler Code-Block verwendet werden, wobei als „Sprache“ \u0026lsquo;ascii\u0026rsquo; angegeben werden muss, oder einfach nur mehr als 10 \u0026lsquo;'\u0026rsquo; dieser sogenannten Backticks.\n``` ascii .---\u0026gt; F A B C D / *-------*-----*---*----*-----\u0026gt; E \\ ^ \\ v / \u0026#39;---\u0026gt; G B --\u0026gt; C -\u0026#39; ``` Siehe hierzu den Abschnitt ASCII-Art #2 der Dokumentation.\nDiagramme Es gibt aber auch die Möglichkeit einfache Diagramme und Kurvenverläufe zu zeichnen, diese können sogar farblich sein. Dabei bestimmt das genutzte Zeichen oder der Buchstabe, die Darstellung der Kurve oder der Punkte.\ndiagram title 1.5 | * | (* stars) y | * * - | * * a | * * * x | * * i | * s | * | * * * 0 +------------------------------------------ 2.0 x-axis 100 Siehe hierfür den Abschnitt Charts in der Dokumentation.\n#13 Macros verstehen und anwenden Erweiterung der LiaScript-Funktionalität mit Macros\nSich wiederholende Aufgaben können mit Macros automatisiert werden, bzw. existieren schon einige, die direkt von euch genutzt werden können. Dabei ist Folgendes zu beachten:\nMacros definieren einen einfachen Mechanismus zur Textersetzung.\nMacros werden mit einem vorangestellten @ markiert, hierbei ist auf Groß- und klein-Schreibung zu achten.\nMacros werden immer im Kopf eines Dokumentes definiert, das ist der erste HTML-Kommentar im Dokument.\nMacros können aber auch überschrieben werden, je Unterabschnitt.\nEs können Parameter übergeben werden:\ndiese werden mit Komma voneinander getrennt (@macro(p1,p2,p3))\nfalls ein Parameter ein Komma enthält, dann kann die Markdown Notation genutzt werden\n@macro(`p1 mit, Komma und einer Zeile mit drei ))) Klammern`,p2,``` p3 ist ein mehrzeiliges Element, das ersetzt werden soll ```) Macros aus anderen Kursen können mit @import in den eigenen Kurs übernommen werden.\nSchaut euch unbedingt den Abschnitt Macros in der Dokumentation an. Und besucht https://github.com/LiaTemplates \u0026hellip; Diese Seite enthält eine Sammlung von Kursen, deren Funktionalität ihr direkt in euren Kurs einbauen könnt, die Sammlung enthält Beispiele für verschiedene Programmiersprachen, Visualisierungen und Grafiken, Simulationen und weiteres. Wir werden dieses freie Angebot in der Zukunft noch weiter aufstocken.\n#14 Publizieren auf GitHub v2 Hier eine verbesserte Version zum Publizieren auf GitHub.

These claims are proved by adopting metrics from software-development, additionally a possible solution is presented: LiaScript is a domain-specific language that is based on Markdown and open-source principles, targeting interactive online-course development.\n1 Introduction Learning Management Systems, so called LMSs, gain more and more popularity, especially in university education. Although these are mostly systems developed under an open-source license, they are commonly applied to restrict the access to educational resources. Cynically one could say, they are simply a continuation of locked up lecturer halls, brought to the internet. But even more than that, the integrated authoring tools offered by these LMS actually restrict the creation of online-course through unnecessary complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), with lots of plugins, options, descriptions and repetitive click-events. Additionally, a course created with one system cannot easily be shared, translated, adapted by other authors, or simply reusing parts or apply versioning is not possible.\nTo prove these claims, we apply metrics from software- and GUI-development to measure the intricateness of the most widely applied systems. Furthermore, we show how most common problems in online-course development can be avoided, with a simple shift in mindset.\n… instead of forcing humans to create courses by typing and clicking onto an endless set of opaque GUI elements, that can be easily interpreted and rendered by a machine … we should enable humans to express their thoughts and ideas with a simple and more natural language …\n… that is why LiaScript was created …\n2 Lineup of Different Ideologies This comparison is focused on the creation and dissemination of educational content only. However, most LMSs also offer many sophisticated features on communication, management, assessment, or user analytics, see therefor [Ca14 , Le05 , Ma08 ].\n2.1 LiaScript: Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Open-courSe Development LiaScript [Di19 ] was born out of the idea to let anybody (even without programming skills) develop high-quality online-courses, with focus on content and the latest web-technologies. It was founded on open-source principles, simplicity, and (re)usability. The figure below shows some features of LiaScript:\nScreen-shot of the development process of online-courses with the Atom editor and the liascript-preview plugin (with LiaScript code on the left and the rendered and result on the right) A course is text-file written in Markdown [MD19 ], a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, designed for readability. Courses can be hosted as open-source projects on GitHub1, together with required multimedia content, JavaScript libraries, and any other data. Code-blocks (line 46) can be made executable by attaching a JavaScript script-tag that defines how the source-code should be processed. To ease this step, we provide macros (line 54) that get replaced by HTML, JavaScript, CSS-annotations, Markdown, etc. Such macros can be parameterized and are evaluated by an internal text-substitution system at compile time. Additionally, it is also possible to import macros from other courses, which reduces boilerplate code.\nThe support for quizzes is backed into the language (see line 58). Adding a new line with starting double brackets adds also a new option to the quiz. Singe-choice quizzes are defined similarly, but with parenthesis [(X)]. LiaScript has also support for [[text|select]] and generic-quizzes [[!]]. Hints [[?]] can be attached as well as more expressive solutions.\nASCII-art (line 63-74) gets translated into nicely rendered images. LiaScript has also support for effects and transitions, similar to PowerPoint, and native support for text2speech, which can be used to develop screen-cast like presentations, among with other features (see the documentation https://github.com/liaScript/docs) . But above all, it is still Markdown that can be read/written without a technical background.\n2.2 LMS: Restricted Access to Educational Resources As the name suggest, a LMS is more about managing educational resources, administration, controlling access, and reporting and tracking on user progress, than it is about creating new content. Additionally, various communication channels are provided between students and teachers, such as wikis, forums, and chats. The offered authoring tools are mostly WYSIWIG2-editors, but they also do have support for plugins or extensions that allow to create more sophisticated learning materials with quizzes, multimedia content, user repositories, etc. Indeed, this was only a brief overview on LMSs, for more detailed information see [Fa11 ].\n3 Methodology We chose some of the most popular LMSs (i.e., Moodle, ILIAS, Canvas, Edmondo)2 for the comparison with LiaScript, which is not trivial task, since LiaScript represents an entirely text-based approach, while the LMSs are based on GUIs. Nevertheless, both are used solve similar tasks: creating, adapting, and sharing educational content. We apply different metrics to identify quantitative differences. Qualitative measurements are probably possible, but require larger analysis, while the results remain highly speculative.\nHow many Lines Of Code (LOC) are required to print out “Hello World” on the console with a certain programming language? This is a simple metric to compare programming language simplicity and to measure boilerplate code. The example below, shows how this task is solved in Python, it requires one LOC and one command to execute it:\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) # command: python HelloWorld.py With correct indentation, C++ requires 6 or at least 5 LOC in total to solve the same problem (see line 47 in Fig. 1). Two steps are needed to compile and execute the code. A more complex metric that is based on this principle is the Time To Hello World metric (TTHW) or in other words From Zero to Hero metric. It is often applied as a key determinant in programming languages and measures the time it takes for a novice programmer to write and execute the first HelloWorld program. But, this metric is also applied to measure the “usability” of an Application Program Interface (API) [An16 ]. An API is an abstract set of clearly defined methods, that control the access and configuration of certain functionalities, which are offered by a software module or library. Hence, there is little difference to a GUI, which is used for the same purpose, but on program-level. Thus, successful HelloWorld-states can also be quantified in GUI development, how long does it take to complete a task (time-on-task), number of clicks (also page-views), task level satisfaction (subjective measure on the difficulty of a task), next to others.\nWe provide an unconventional shortcut get to the LMS metrics, instead of performing various tests with different user groups [Bu08 ] or usability experts [MF15 ] we simply ask professionals. There are various tutorials on YouTube explaining how to set up a course in a certain environment. We analyzed the top ranked tutorials on integrating multimedia resources and quizzes for the chosen LMS. We measured their length (time-on-task) and counted the number of performed clicks and page-switches. If multiple solutions were presented in one video, then the average was stored. The number of comments with focus on difficulty (-1) or simplicity (+1) were summed up and associated with task-level-satisfaction.\n4 Comparison We try to discuss several aspects and provide the measured metrics. All recorded data is stored for further review at the Open Science Framework (visit https://osf.io/3rweg) . At the end the reader has to decide, which approach fits more for her/his purposes, based on personal preferences and skills.\n4.1 What are the Requirements for Development? All LMSs require a server installation with a login. Thus, working on a course mostly happens online and via the offered web-interface and with the required user permissions. Mostly in that case means, that there are some desktop-authoring systems (e.g. iSpring authoring Tool), which do have support for SCORM2 and can be used to work offline. But, not all LMSs do have support for this standard, which makes it even a more a challenging task to get such content imported into the desired LMS. In contrast to this, a LiaScript course can be a simple git-repository3 hosted/published on Github and developed locally. Everything that is required is a simple text editor. To ease the development process with the Atom editor, a snippets-plugin4 is provided, next to the previewer, which provides a search on all language features and inserts fragments, it also provides more detailed information and examples.\n4.2 How to add Multimedia Resources? As depicted in the image below, the integration of audio and video-content is just an extension to the common Markdown syntax for links. A link can be given a name in brackets, which is followed by an absolute or relative URL in parentheses. A starting exclamation mark is used to indicate an image resource. That was the Markdown part so far. In LiaScript you can use a question mark to indicate audio resources (we hoped that this somehow resembles an ear) and by combining the image with the audio notation, it is possible insert video content. By doing this, the additional elements are still valid links in Markdown and any other Markdown-viewer, but in LiaScript this multimedia content gets displayed automatically within the appropriate web-player.\ntest fu bar\nTab. 1: Short-codes for references on the left and the rendered result in LiaScript on the right.\nShort-code Result [link](url.html) link ![image](url.jpg) [link](url.html) Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. !?[video](url.mp4) However, as the screen-casts reveal, integrating multimedia content to one of the LMSs seems to be a more challenging task and requires to deal with a couple of user interfaces. The overall average time-on-task was 3:06 minutes and required 11 clicks and 5 page changes.\nTab. 2: Average user-interface metrics for attaching movies to 4 LMSs (see https://osf.io/kb845) System time-on-task # of clicks # of pages satisfaction Canvas 02:56 10.4 5.1 0.83 Edmodo 02:33 9.1 2.9 0.00 ILIAS 02:59 11.2 5.3 0.00 Moodle 03:51 13.9 7.3 0.27 If content from other websites (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, TeacherTube, Soundcloud, etc.) was imported, users had to work with HTML code. Thus, search for the embed-code on the content-site and import it by switching to code editing mode. Compare this, with the LiaScript notation. LiaScript also recognized links from the aforementioned sources. Hence, you only have to provide a link to the desired YouTube-site and the video will be embedded automatically. But, it has to be noted that a similar solution is offered by Canvas, which requires only 3 clicks and embeds the video view, only by pasting a YouTube-URL.\n4.3 Where is all the Data? For a LMS the case is clear, everything is stored on the server. The progress and state of each user is recorded, which enables sophisticated tracking and reporting, and thus provide useful information for course developers and teachers. LiaScript courses in contrast are freely accessible and store all states and the personal progress locally within the browser. A registration or login is not required, which might be considered as a first barrier by some users, before starting or simply trying a course. But, this local storing of personal data might also be considered as a drawback, because opening the same course on another device or even in another browser is like a new start.\n4.4 How to add quizzes? Of course, adding quizzes takes longer than including multimedia resources and is much more diverse. The overall mean time-on-task was 6:47 minutes, which required 36 clicks and 10 page changes on average. The task-level-satisfaction was also worse, there are two notable cases for Moodle: One person was speaking ironically about the “very intuitive way of creating course”, while another one used the phrase “Damn it”, after multiple attempts in creating the same course, due to some lost configuration settings.\nTab. 3: Average user-interface metrics for adding quizzes to 4 LMSs (see https://osf.io/kb845) System time-on-task # of clicks # of pages satisfaction Canvas 08:34 51.2 15.6 0.38 Edmodo 05:59 24.9 8.2 -0.10 ILIAS 04:04 19.3 7.7 0.10 Moodle 08:33 47.5 9.9 -0.92 Compare this with the creation of quizzes in LiaScript, as depicted below (or see lines 58 and 59 in Fig. 1). It requires only a little amount of boilerplate code to create different types of quizzes.\n[[solution]] [[ create a | (selection **quiz**) | $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2} =\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$ ]] [[X]] a multiple-choice [[ ]] quiz, that requires [[X]] the 1^st^ and 3^rd^ option [[ ]] to be selected [( )] a single-choice [( )] quiz with only [(X)] one solution Rendered quizzes, defined by the short-codes above. Of course, our way of creating quizzes can only be used for self-evaluation and not as in a LMS for assessment with points, penalties, max. number of retrials, shuffling, etc. In all systems it was therefor possible to define quiz-banks, which are used as a repositories and allow to display a subset of different quizzes to different users. LiaScript in contrast defines quizzes in a plain-text format, visible to all that know the “raw” course URL (see the next section).\n4.5 Support for versioning and internationalization/localization? To be short, we found no hints on versioning in LMSs. Although, there are different back-up strategies offered and SCORM could also be used as a format for versioning, it does not allow to host/run different versions of a course in parallel. It exists only one course in the most up-to-date version or different courses that represent different versions. Thus, internationalization/localization requires to repeat every change in every translated version of a course.\nLiaScript does not support versioning by default, but by using git and publishing on GitHub, these features come for free. It is possible to refer to the most up-to-date version (1), use tags to define versions (2), or to open any uploaded version, since every update is labeled with an unique identifier (3).\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/master/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/1.0.0/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/434dd2188294296cf68bab49c97cb75582ee59d3/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/german/README.md Remember, LiaScript is only a text-file and to be complete, a Unicode text-file, which allows to create courses in any known language and to publish them in parallel, only by using git-branches (4).\n4.6 Support for Extensions \u0026amp; Add-ons? Extensions or Add-ons allow to develop courses with more interactive and thus eye-catching elements. Before they can be used, they need to be installed on the server-side, which affects the LMS user interface and requires enough user permissions. On the other it exists a standard for Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), that allows to link content or apply services from so-called LTI provider to a LMS course, see [Se10 ]. This content is integrated via an iframe and authentication is handled in the background.\nIn contrast to this, every LiaScript course can define its own “extensions” as macros, as it was briefly introduced in Sec. 2.1. These macros can be shared among different courses, either by copy and pasting the source-code directly into the main-header of the LiaScript document or by using the following directive (also within the main-header):\nimport: https://raw-course-url.md\nIf a course is hosted on Github, it is possible to reference to any desired version, as it was highlighted within the previous section. All required macros, JavaScript libraries, CSS style-sheets, will automatically be loaded at the initialization. See also the template-index (https://github.com/liaTemplates) , which provides a list of self-documenting macros, ranging from 360 degree imaging, computer algebra, visualization, up to online programming in various languages.\n5 Discussion LMSs are more about recording users and generating scores and reports to measure their progress. This becomes even more obvious, if you search for Add-ons and extensions for your LMS2. Only a minority is dealing with content and the integration of new interactive elements. Thus, even if someone is willing to create online courses this way, the majority of GUI elements with too many settings and required clicks and page switches seem to be more daunting than useful. Learning and understanding all of these concepts (and every plugin probably posses its own user logic) before being able to add some content, seems to be simply wrong. That is why we believe that LMS are not only used to restrict the access to educational resources, but also restrict their creation.\nLiaScript was developed from an opposite perspective, by focusing on content first through the usage of a simple but yet extendable DSL. This allows to treat courses similar to open-source projects, which can be shared and developed accordingly even by larger developer groups. Since in teaching there is no single source of truth, there can also exist multiple versions of the same course. In open-source terminology that means: a teacher could simply “fork” an existing course and modify or translate it into another language and “push” the changes back or proceed with his own course. Due to discussions with students, the course can be continuously improved by “committing” new versions, while older ones are still accessible, or by creating “branches” for different groups of students. This might sound odd for a non-programmer, but makes totally sense for every programmer3.\nAdditionally, even without an online interpreter, the LiaScript remains readable and editable as a text document. One of the key-challenges of LiaScript was to overcome this segregation of learning materials into textbooks, PowerPoint presentations, and videos. By using this DSL, the user can decide what is her/his favorite mode and switch between.\nBibliography [Ca14]\tCavus, N., Zabadi, T.: A Comparison Of Open Source Learning Management Systems.

So the idea was born to create a DSL that is based on Markdown but intended to be used for developing online courses, that look like screen-cast with various interactive elements. Starting this project with Elm, it was more or less an explorative journey, with rapid changes in the DSL and the interpreter that were guided by the Elm-compiler. Code-blocks are now executable and editable, quizzes can be defined in various ways, images are generated from ASCII-art, effects and transitions combined with text2speech that enable interactive storytelling, among other features. But the course itself is still a valid Markdown document that can be edited by any ordinary person, even without programming skills. The interpreter build around the Elm-architecture hides all complexity, such as code evaluation, internal message routing, lazy parsing, etc.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-a-domain-specific-language-for-interactive-online-courses/","title":"LiaScript: a domain-specific-language for interactive online courses","description":"We will have a full-day workshop at the eLearning Africa conference in Dakar on creating free and open interactive courses with LiaScript Markdown.

LiaScript is an attempt to enable everyone to create free and interactive online courses, without the need of being an experienced programmer. Instead, it aims to bring both parties, software-and course-developers, closer together by introducing Open-Source techniques into the Open-courSe development process. LiaScript was designed to be compatible to Common-Markdown, but it introduces lots of language extensions that deal with quizzes, surveys, ASCII-art, text2speech, animations, online programming, the integration of JavaScript, etc. as well as its own macro-system that simplifies tedious and repetitive tasks. It comes along with its own just-in-time compiler that runs in the browser and therefor does not require additional tooling.\ndownload / liascript / github bibtex @InProceedings{dietrich2019, author = {Andr\\\u0026#39;e Dietrich}, title = {LiaScript: a domain-specific-language for interactive online courses}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning 2019}, year = {2019}, pages = {186--194}, address = {Porto, Portugal} } "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/berlearn-talk-2019/","title":"LiaScript - BearLearn Talk 2019","description":"This is an early example of a LiaScript presentation, that was given as a BearLearn Talk 2019 in Berlin.

Im Projekt kooperieren das Institut für intelligente Kooperative Systeme (OVGU-Magdeburg), das Zentrum für Hochschuldidaktik und angewandte Hochschulforschung (HS Magdeburg-Stendal), das Institut für Maschinenbau (HS Magdeburg-Stendal) und der Lehrstuhl Hochschulforschung und Professionalisierung der akademischen Lehre (OVGU-Magdeburg).\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/the-vision-of-liascript/","title":"The Vision of LiaScript","description":"This poster represents one of the earliest publications on LiaScript, showcasing our pioneering ideas on leveraging open-source methodologies to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).","date":"May 7, 2018","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/vision-of-liascript_hu6d09bbe98ac44307b4d5c3e02c39af33_270032_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"205\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/vision-of-liascript_hu6d09bbe98ac44307b4d5c3e02c39af33_270032_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/vision-of-liascript_hu6d09bbe98ac44307b4d5c3e02c39af33_270032_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/vision-of-liascript_hu6d09bbe98ac44307b4d5c3e02c39af33_270032_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Conference, Publication","tags":"LiaScript","content":"This poster represents one of the earliest publications on LiaScript, showcasing our pioneering ideas on leveraging open-source methodologies to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Over the years, LiaScript has undergone significant evolution, yet the foundational principles, key concepts, and the syntax have steadfastly remained unchanged. We made a minor but crucial modification in our approach to embedding videos; we shifted from using the !! link syntax to !?. This change was implemented to avoid confusion with other markdown interpreters and platforms like GitHub, ensuring our examples remain accessible and functional. These examples continue to serve as valuable resources for those looking to craft their own courses.\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to underline that the essence of our content lies within a single, interpretable text file, processed by a browser-based application. This unique approach allows for continuous improvement of the application\u0026rsquo;s user experience while simultaneously empowering educators to refine and update course content. Our decision to focus on a browser-app over developing a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle has proven to be a strategic choice. It has enabled us to avoid the pitfalls of quickly outdated course materials, offering a dynamic and flexible learning environment that stands the test of time.\nFor more insights into LiaScript and to start creating your own open-source MOOCs, explore the documatation available at:\nLiaScript 0.14 - Full Documentation (English) This is a screencast of the LiaScript documentation in presentation mode spoken by LiaScript itself ;-) \u0026hellip; and engage with our community on GitHub .\nOur journey from the inception of LiaScript to its current state highlights our commitment to open education and the potential of open-source tools in transforming the landscape of online learning. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to enhancing LiaScript as an alternative to centralized platforms and expanding the possibilities for educators worldwide to create engaging, accessible, and high-quality online courses.\n"}]
