It is no wonder that many initially think of licenses and terms of use. Creation (2.) seems boring and time-consuming. As an OER enthusiast, one starts with big ideas, which often fail due to a lack of technical skills and underestimated effort. Thus, most projects unfortunately end in static formats such as PDFs, Word documents, images, or PowerPoint presentations. Podcasts or educational films are more elaborate, and creating a website requires even more effort. With some programming knowledge, one might even create an entire app. With a Word document, an individual can still make changes (leaving aside the collaboration of author teams), but PDFs, videos, and podcasts are one-way products (which cannot be adjusted afterward), and with websites and apps, an outsider might be able to make changes but faces insurmountable technical hurdles or simply lacks access rights. In the worst case, development and hosting even incur costs that one has to bear themselves.\nParticipation, as we wish for it and as we know it from the open-source world, is actually not possible in this way. Cynically viewed, the PDF file is the stone tablet of the digital age, static and optimal for print media (but not suitable for reading on a smartphone), not interactive, and difficult to change. However, a computer enables us to experiment, simulate, immerse in content, change something, and verify it.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t an OER enthusiast simply change two lines in an app or translate it? Or why can\u0026rsquo;t a user (students/parents) rephrase quiz questions or even restructure content?\nAs mentioned before, because the technical skills are lacking and secondly, because it could otherwise lead to a huge mess with different versions.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what OER creation is about: diversity, changeability, and continuous improvement \u0026hellip;\nSpoiler Alert: The following video shows how interactive teaching content is created at TU Bergakademie Freiberg with LiaScript and hosted on GitHub (we will get to both). Each point represents a file and each figure a person who changes, adds, or deletes a file; these are on one hand employees of the Software Development and Robotics working group and on the other hand students.\n!?Collaboration in the creation of OER at TUBAF\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Source: https://github.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/\nIf we orient ourselves towards the open-source movement, then OER could actually work, right? Many initially small projects that grow over time and through organized and decentralized participation of many over the years. How does that work?\nAbout the Economics of Open-Source Projects One thing is clear: Everyone who works on an open-source project has a common goal. They use a library or app for their own purposes and give back a part of their value creation. When large companies like Facebook or Microsoft release open-source projects, the many volunteers are an enormous force that not only finds bugs but also brings in extensions, writes tests, and documentation. They benefit from it themselves.\nImagine if large educational publishers in Germany put their content online under a free license as an OER/OS project, so that many teachers and learners could work together on the materials or create their own versions from them. Unthinkable! And why is that?\nBecause open-source projects have something that OER (still) does not: a common (programming) language. A language in which communities develop around small or huge projects, be it the Linux operating system, the Firefox browser, AI projects, or educational apps.\nBesides the language, there is another ingredient that allows the work of countless authors to be organized, versioned, and orchestrated. A decentralized version control tool called git is used for this, with GitHub.com as the largest platform. Review systems, discussions, automated tests (spelling), and much more are already integrated here. These problems are considered solved here and are nothing new for most developers and have been for over a decade.\nWhat does the e-learning community or edTech have to counter this? Right, an almost endless number of platforms, tools, and formats that drive us more and more apart and isolate us rather than bring us together. Who knows that on Moodle XY, which is hosted at school ABC in Weißenfels, a teacher is developing a similar course to mine \u0026hellip;\nIn the following sections, we will deal with the LiaScript language. There are already many good tutorials and courses on git and GitHub. In the following video, you will get a very good brief introduction to the concepts of git and GitHub. Believe us, it is worth it.\nUnlike all other platforms you may have tried, GitHub will be the last one you will use.\nFun Fact: Git also comes from the pen of Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux. He was dissatisfied with the commercial version control tools at the time and sought a way to work on Linux in a decentralized and offline manner. Here is a short history of git:\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git\nLiaScript – A Language for OER The idea for LiaScript originated in 2017/2018 in the \u0026ldquo;Industrial eLab\u0026rdquo; project. It was about developing online labs for teaching in engineering sciences. The following video shows our first steps with LiaScript.\nWe were looking for a way to quickly and easily produce teaching content as a team. Markdown, as an easy-to-learn and already established markup language, offered itself as a common foundation. HTML is also a markup language, as the name HyperText Markup Language suggests, but it is much more complicated. Markdown has now become the standard for blogging (JAM-Stack), documentation of IT projects (GitHub), with editors in Moodle and others – all use/support Markdown more or less.\nTry sending the following message via WhatsApp:\nWith such annotations, Markdown allows simple formatting like code, italics, bold, and strikethrough in texts, and these can also be combined/nested. Texts can be structured just as easily:\nYou can immediately see what is a table and what is a list. As a finger exercise, everyone can try to expand the table with more cells or columns. Then simply press the \u0026ldquo;Compile\u0026rdquo; button at the top right and observe how the result changes. In your mind, try to remember which menu items in Word or PowerPoint need to be clicked for this. If you can do that, then we are more than impressed 😉\nVisual Metaphors \u0026amp; Quizzes You can think of Markdown as a kind of \u0026ldquo;visual metaphor\u0026rdquo; to describe the structure of texts and other elements. Your canvas is a simple text file and your brushes are the keyboard. No clicking and remembering complicated sequences with different menus, just writing and seeing what happens. This was also our core idea in developing LiaScript, to bring the didactic experts on the team on board. We wanted to extend the visual and simple language of Markdown and add more interactive elements that seamlessly integrate into the Markdown language.\nThe following example shows a simple \u0026ldquo;to-do\u0026rdquo; list:\nWe have simply further developed these to-do lists, as shown below, to also include quizzes and surveys in our teaching materials. This allowed the didactic experts to gather feedback from the students or observe their progress.\nThe square representation above is reminiscent of checkboxes as used in HTML. For single-choice quizzes, one would use round radio buttons, where only one option can be selected:\nMore Quizzes If you extend this idea by using double brackets [[...]] for quizzes, you can create a variety of other quizzes in the form of cloze tests, selection options, matrix quizzes, etc., in combination with other Markdown elements. Here is an example of a \u0026ldquo;German Grammar Test\u0026rdquo;:\nAdmittedly, the above example for a quiz is a bit too large; it was only meant to serve as an example. LiaScript offers additional possibilities to provide hints or additional options, making it easier to design or configure a quiz.\nSurveys Admittedly, the above example for a quiz is a bit too large; it was only meant to serve as an example. LiaScript offers additional possibilities to provide hints or additional options, making it easier to design or configure a quiz.\nTry converting this multiple-choice survey into a single-choice survey yourself.\nThe advantage of developing learning content in this way was that it could be created by us without any configuration effort and as a team, with the computer scientists creating the learning content and the didactic experts creating the surveys and quizzes to test the knowledge level.\nMultimedia YouTube offers a variety of educational materials, but they cannot be directly embedded in Markdown because most Markdown viewers prohibit JavaScript or embedding external content via IFrames.\nTo also be able to use such content and embed it in LiaScript courses, we have extended the syntax as before. The following example first shows the general Markdown syntax for embedding links and images; then come the LiaScript extensions:\nThe double question marks ?? in the last links indicate that the content should somehow be embedded. LiaScript uses various browser-side strategies to embed simulations from Phet, 3D models from SketchFab, or circuits from Falstad. We have explained the internal workings of LiaScript in more detail in the following blog post:\nEmbedding Multimedia - How does it work??\nProgramming in Markdown When learning to program, many code examples are essential. For this purpose, Markdown already has a syntax, so-called code blocks, which are enclosed with at least three backticks.\nThe top term is an indicator for the programming language and the syntax highlighting to be used, followed by the actual code. Originally, we used a separate editor for our robotics projects, which forced students to constantly copy code back and forth. Our Arduino robots were programmed in C++, which raised the questions:\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t the code examples be executed directly? And what is actually necessary to execute code in other languages? Our solution was to append a \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag that defines how the above code or text should be interpreted. For JavaScript, this is relatively simple:\nEvery code block to which a \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag is appended is interpreted in LiaScript as executable code with console output. Click on Execute and observe how the output changes. Such execution instructions can also be attached to quizzes, surveys, or to-do lists to adjust their behavior. @input simply defines a general placeholder here and everywhere, indicating where the current code should be inserted in the script.\nWithin a code block, changes are tracked using linear versioning. In other words, you can move forward and backward in your versions and change an old state, which is then appended as a new state – no change is lost.\nThe didactic experts on our team could directly analyze the students\u0026rsquo; approach to programming. At this point, many ask: Where are the data/states stored in LiaScript – the code, the quizzes, and surveys? The answer is simple: directly in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. Modern browsers have built-in databases like IndexedDB, which we use to store the courses and all related information. With LiaScript, it is therefore not necessary to send data around the globe and store it in a central database. Instead, LiaScript works in a decentralized manner. Knowledge can also be tested offline, meaning each user can go through the learning materials at their own pace and completely anonymously.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Industrial eLab\u0026rdquo; project, we reused this data for research purposes. We ourselves did not yet know the possibilities a modern browser offers.\nProjects In addition to simple code blocks, projects can also be defined that consist of multiple code blocks/files. These are simply concatenated and also appended with an additional \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag. To avoid confusion with the blocks, it must be specified which block is to be inserted where. @input(0) addresses the first code block and @input(1) refers to the JSON file, etc.\nOpen the upper part, adjust both code blocks, and click on \u0026ldquo;Execute\u0026rdquo;. Whether a block is open or closed is defined by a plus or minus sign in front of the file name.\nExternal libraries or external services like our CodeRunner can also be used for execution. The scripts necessary for this quickly grow in scope and complexity, making them difficult to maintain. To counteract this, we developed a macro system that allows recurring tasks to be simplified (automated), as is common in computer science. In LiaScript, Markdown documents can be treated like libraries that implement specific functions and can be reused in other courses or Markdown files. The idea behind this is explained in the next section; if this is too technical for you, you can skip this part.\nExtensions and Macros Macros are an excellent way to simplify and automate recurring tasks. In short, these are just text replacements that can be inserted at any point. To do this, simply define a command/name in an HTML comment at the beginning of the document, followed by everything that should be inserted:\nAs in other programming languages, these can also be parameterized in LiaScript. In the macro body, the places to be replaced are marked with @0..9:\nImporting Extensions Of course, no one wants to always copy all commands back and forth. As you would expect from a library, such macro collections can be easily integrated into the current course using an @import statement. In the following example, another document is imported that allows embedding ABC notations for creating musical scores.\nWhy shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you be able to program with music as well? Notes are a form of programming language that allows you to compose music. And in LiaScript, this can also happen interactively using ABC notation. Change the code and click on \u0026ldquo;Compile\u0026rdquo; to see and hear the changes. As shown in the section \u0026ldquo;Programming in Markdown\u0026rdquo;, you only need to append a \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag. In the example below, this happens automatically by appending the macro @ABCJS.eval.\nText can also be analyzed to improve readability or style, for example. At TU Freiberg, this is used in foreign language classes to provide students with direct feedback using various metrics:\nAs already mentioned, we mostly use LiaScript for learning to program. An overview of existing extensions can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/topics/liascript-template\nOtherwise, we are happy to add new extensions for you or support you in this process in LiaScript.\nAnd for scientific publishing, there are also extensions that you can use:\nAdditional Features Different Display Formats Since computer scientists tend to optimize and automate work, we have integrated the function in LiaScript to read a document either page by page like a normal book or to include animation steps. Thus, the same document can be used both as a slide set in lectures and by students in book mode or presentation mode with built-in speech output. Modern browsers nowadays offer text-to-speech functions, the quality of which can vary depending on the device, operating system, and browser.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t want to go into too much detail here, but the following video provides a brief summary of the usage. Similar to quizzes, everything related to animations or speech output is marked by two curly braces {{}}.\nRecently, you can even use your audio recordings or video recordings to narrate your courses. You are already familiar with the LiaScript notation for audio and video. The following video shows how you can link these with the comments.\nASCII Art ASCII Art stands for \u0026ldquo;American Standard Code for Information Interchange\u0026rdquo; art, a graphic design technique where images, symbols, or text are created by arranging characters from the ASCII character table. This art form, which dates back to the early days of computer technology, originated from the need to create graphical representations on devices with limited graphical capabilities.\nIn LiaScript, ASCII art can be used creatively to integrate visual representations directly into texts. This can be particularly useful for creating simple diagrams, sketches, or symbols without requiring external image files.\nOf course, LiaScript and Markdown can also be seamlessly combined with ASCII graphics. This allows for interesting combinations with quizzes, but also animations. The LiaScript elements just need to be \u0026ldquo;marked\u0026rdquo; with quotation marks:\nAutomatic Visualizations Datasets in tables are automatically analyzed, and various rules are used to try to find the best representation. Switch to the table view, rearrange the columns, and observe how the visualization adjusts.\nAnyone who wants to start drawing right away can do so and draw simple diagrams and curves. If it looks like a diagram, then it probably is a diagram \u0026hellip;\nFormulas In LiaScript, formulas can be easily inserted into Markdown documents by using the proven LaTeX syntax. This syntax allows for clear and precise representation of mathematical expressions, which is particularly important in scientific and technical texts.\nThe inline notation is used to insert formulas directly into the text. This is done by placing the mathematical expression between two dollar signs ($...$). This method is ideal for shorter formulas or simple mathematical expressions that fit into a sentence.\nFor more complex or extensive formulas that require their own line, the block notation is used. Here, the mathematical expression is placed between two double dollar signs ($$...$$). The formula is then centered and prominently displayed.\nLiaScript offers much more, but we want to leave it with the \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; elements and move on to dynamic elements in the next section. A feature that we wanted to integrate from the beginning and which we still see as a hidden gem of LiaScript is the use of JavaScript.\nJavaScript Everywhere JavaScript? At first glance, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound particularly grand, but we were inspired by Bret Victor. Here is a lecture that summarizes many of his ideas, many of which should also flow into OER projects:\nWe have reinterpreted the use of JavaScript. Free \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags can appear anywhere in the text in LiaScript. Unlike Jupyter Notebooks, where text is written around the code, in LiaScript the code is directly embedded in texts, tables, etc.\nThe execution of a script can have a result that is also displayed directly. Unlike in JavaScript, where the code merely manipulates the document from the outside and makes changes that are difficult for the user or reader to interpret. What does this look like specifically?\nIn the simplest case, calculations that you do not want to perform yourself can be executed within such a script:\nThis is nothing special yet. But if we imagine how many educational materials use current climate, economic, or social data, it quickly becomes clear how important it is that this data is not only correct but also up-to-date.\nA simple example of this is calendar calculation:\nThis document will now always display the actual number of days and format it accordingly. The highlighted background indicates that this text or number was generated by the calculation of a script. The user also has the option to inspect and modify the respective code by double-clicking. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to blindly trust the results of calculations summarized in a document; you can also directly verify them and perform your own calculations.\nIn LiaScript, we can go a step further and link scripts directly with input options as well as connect scripts with each other. This means that if the result of one script changes, the dependent scripts will also be recalculated. The parameter \u0026lsquo;output\u0026rsquo; is used to give the script a name. This result can then be referenced within other scripts throughout the document using \u0026lsquo;@input(name)\u0026rsquo;. Within LiaScript, a processing graph is created where scripts whose inputs \u0026lsquo;@input\u0026rsquo;s have changed are recalculated.\nChange the values of the sliders and observe the changes in the diagram.\nNow everyone is probably thinking: \u0026ldquo;Phew, that\u0026rsquo;s really just for programmers.\u0026rdquo; But far from it. Thanks to ChatGPT, which also generates \u0026ldquo;Markdown\u0026rdquo;, we can have such diagrams or other elements created by AI. An AI will not achieve this right away if it has not been trained on LiaScript, but we can give it context. In this case, the context would be an example from the documentation that we would like ChatGPT or Claude.AI to adapt for our purposes.\nIn the following blog post, we show how to generate various diagrams with a single prompt, using the above example, without writing a single line of code ourselves:\nhttps://liascript.github.io/blog/creating-interactive-diagrams-with-chatgpt/\nWhy LiaScript? We believe that OER does not need another platform, learning management system, or authoring tool that only further separates OER creators. Instead, we need a simple language that anyone can use and extend. A language in which teams can collaborate to work on content, functionality, and representations together, each in their own way. A language for OER offers another advantage over platforms and tools: users can freely express their creativity, develop their own functions and extensions using this language, and are not trapped in fixed input masks and structures.\nDecentralization can also foster innovation by allowing for experimentation and local adaptations without the failure of a single project endangering the entire system. A decentralized approach could also promote the development of open, community-shared resources that are freely accessible and can be further developed by the entire educational community. This would not only improve the sustainability of the projects but also promote the democratization of knowledge.\nIn summary, LiaScript offers the following:\nAccessibility: Anyone can create or edit materials with a simple text editor. No special software is required.\nInteractivity: Add quizzes, simulations, and videos directly into your documents to make learning more exciting and effective.\nCollaboration: By using GitHub, you can work on projects together, track changes, and manage different versions of a document – all in a form understandable to non-technicians.\nDecentralization: Your content is not tied to a specific platform. It can be freely shared and adapted, creating a true community around learning.\nDecentralization in combination with Git and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket also offers a completely different form of sustainability: No intermediate version is lost; each of these intermediate versions can be recalled and restored as a course. Anyone using Git or another version control tool has the entire history of a project locally. If GitHub goes offline tomorrow, all participants still have the complete state and can still make changes and synchronize versions with each other without GitHub as a central repository.\nDecentralization Finally, we want to clarify how courses are shared when they are stored and developed in a decentralized manner. For this, only the URL of the plain text file is needed, which either refers to a version on GitHub/GitLab (free) or is hosted by the OER content creators themselves. This \u0026ldquo;document\u0026rdquo; can be found, for example, on GitHub in the following project:\nhttps://github.com/LiaPlayground/Warum-offene-Bildung-eine-Sprache-braucht\nTo access the plain Markdown file, you either click on the corresponding file and then on the small \u0026ldquo;Raw\u0026rdquo; button to get the following URL:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaPlayground/Warum-offene-Bildung-eine-Sprache-braucht/main/English.md\nIf you look closely, you will notice that the URL has changed from github.com to raw.githubusercontent.com and the additional /main/README.md suffix has been added. This means the main branch of the project is used, and the README.md file is downloaded. As mentioned earlier, on GitHub you could also access other branches or previous versions. What is now missing is that this URL is passed as a parameter to the LiaScript website.\nhttps://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaPlayground/Warum-offene-Bildung-eine-Sprache-braucht/main/English.md\nAt first glance, this may seem cumbersome, but it has the advantage that we can change and adapt our content at any time without the URL changing. The LiaScript website is a so-called PWA (Progressive Web App), a pure JavaScript application that can also be installed on the end device. The URL parameter instructs the app to download, analyze, and render the Markdown file located behind the URL locally in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. The first load may take a little longer as the entire structure is analyzed first. The result is stored in the browser itself in the internal IndexedDB database, so it can also be accessed offline. If you click on the home screen in the table of contents, you switch to the following index view:\nhttps://liascript.github.io/course/\nHere, any visited course can be recalled, and you can continue with the material. The LiaScript site is more of a reader/interpreter for LiaScript Markdown than a traditional website. We update the website/interpreter, and you update your content.\nClassrooms Additionally, within a course, you can go to \u0026ldquo;Share Classroom,\u0026rdquo; select one of several synchronization solutions, choose a random name for the classroom, and then click \u0026ldquo;Open.\u0026rdquo; You can share the new URL in the browser with your students, classmates, or colleagues, who can then join the same room. Not only will the same course be opened, but all quizzes and surveys will also be anonymously synchronized. The code editors have a collaborative mode where everyone in the room can work together, and there is a chat that also understands LiaScript syntax, allowing live surveys to be conducted in class similar to Mentimeter.\nWhere are these data stored now? Here, too, only decentralized mechanisms are used. The states of the browsers are synchronized, and if someone leaves the room, they take their own data with them. And when everyone has left the room, these data are forgotten as well. We call this concept Classroom-Lite \u0026hellip;\nWhere do I start? We hope we have convinced you, and if you now feel overwhelmed by the many features and wonder where to begin, how to create and share a course.\nAs a starting point, we recommend the LiaScript website, which we host for free on GitHub:\nhttps://liascript.github.io\nHere you will find more information and also the documentation, which is also written as a LiaScript course, as well as suggestions and news in our blog. We also have a YouTube channel where we regularly introduce new features and use cases:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@liascript4180\nFor those who want to dive right in, we recommend watching the Shorts as well as the interactive documentation translated and recorded in LiaScript:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElxYssylmaw\u0026list=PL7LrRfaZulhc3w4rebIl8Dnck6zqdKeNn\nThe entire project is hosted on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/LiaScript\nYou can give us feedback there, report bugs, or contribute your own extensions.

In our previous blog post, we introduced the \u0026lt;lia-chart\u0026gt; tag—a custom web component that uses eCharts under the hood to easily generate custom diagrams.\nCreating interactive Diagrams with ChatGPT Exploring AI-generated content opens the door to fascinating possibilities. In this article, we delve into how you can leverage AI models, like ChatGPT, to create interactive diagrams that can be customized on the fly. Prompt with Variables and Examples While ChatGPT might not be capable of independently generating complex scripts, it excels at modifying existing code snippets to meet your needs. Take, for example, a script from the LiaScript documentation, specifically from the section on Custom Diagrams with ECharts. For more complex visualizations, you might want to go beyond the basic capabilities of the \u0026lt;lia-chart\u0026gt; tag and tap directly into the eCharts library, particularly when combined with \u0026ldquo;echarts-gl,\u0026rdquo; a WebGL extension for eCharts that enables even more advanced graphical features. This can be done directly within your script tags. Here’s how you can import the necessary libraries in your course setup:\n\u0026lt;!-- script: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5.4.2/dist/echarts.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts-gl@2.0.9/dist/echarts-gl.min.js --\u0026gt; # Your Course Examples Below are some examples illustrating how to combine eCharts with LiaScript inputs. The process is similar to using the \u0026lt;lia-chart\u0026gt; tag, but with a few key differences. For instance, when working with eCharts directly, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to define additional functions that cannot be handled by the \u0026lt;lia-chart\u0026gt; tag alone. Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create a \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; element in your document where the script will render the diagram.\nThe script functions silently in the background—it doesn\u0026rsquo;t produce visible output within the document itself but rather makes the necessary modifications to render the diagram. Whenever the input values associated with the script change, the main script is automatically re-executed, and the diagram updates in real-time.\nWhy is the script re-executed? This happens because of the @input(topic) markers. These markers \u0026ldquo;subscribe\u0026rdquo; to any changes in the scripts that define the specified topic as their output. When those scripts change, the main script is triggered again, ensuring your diagram remains up-to-date.\nLearn More To dive deeper into using the eCharts library directly and explore the comprehensive examples provided in the link below:\neCharts Examples Now that you’re familiar with using ChatGPT to create interactive diagrams, you’re ready to take things to the next level. By combining LiaScript snippets with the more advanced examples from the eCharts library, you can create dynamic visualizations that bring your ideas to life. The possibilities are endless — start experimenting and visualize everything you can imagine!\nAutomate with Macros To streamline your workflow, especially when working with repetitive eCharts diagrams, you can create custom macros. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick example to demonstrate how you can use macros to simplify your coding process.\nWhen incorporating code into a macro, the following syntax is recommended:\n```language @macro(params) console.log(\u0026#34;The code block is passed as the last parameter\u0026#34;) ... ``` This syntax is utilized in the examples below. The @echarts macro is defined in the document\u0026rsquo;s main header and is designed to accept two parameters. The first parameter is the background theme, which can be set to either light or dark. The second parameter is the code block that generates the diagram.\nRather than directly injecting LiaScript code, this macro uses a helper function @echarts_. It first calls the @uid macro to generate a unique ID, which is then assigned to the \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; element and used in the document.getElementById query. The macro then passes the background parameter and the code block, which is enclosed in triple backticks to denote a multi-line string. If you\u0026rsquo;re working with a single line of code, you can use single backticks to indicate the string, especially if it includes additional commas.\nYour standard Markdown viewer will still highlight the code blocks as usual, but the LiaScript interpreter will go a step further by transforming them into fully interactive diagrams.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/teach-your-ai-to-generate-liascript-previews/","title":"Teach Your AI to Generate LiaScript Previews","description":"","date":"August 20, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/ai-course-preview_hu15677815213369311536.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/ai-course-preview_hu2607656689875331050.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/ai-course-preview_hu4687760817278258011.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/ai-course-preview_hu17587027358873607494.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article","tags":"LiaScript, ChatGPT","content":"Claude.ai offers a powerful feature in its paid version that allows you to preview generated code directly. However, with a simple prompt, you can teach any AI to create LiaScript previews on demand—even if you’re using a free version.\nWhat Are Data-URIs? In a previous post, we briefly covered how you can use data-URIs to encode LiaScript content.\nWhere is Content Stored? Did you know that LiaScript tries to be agnostic as possible, when it comes to hosting? The thing is, you host your content by your own and only refer to it, via a URL-Parameter that you attach to the LiaScript website. https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?THE_URL_TO_YOUR_COURSE.md Git - Platforms Although, we prefer GitHub \u0026amp; git for versioning, hosting, and publishing, you should be able to use any versioning system or platform to host your course content. But what exactly is a data-URI? A data-URI is a URI scheme that enables you to embed data directly within web pages, treating it as if it were an external resource. In the context of LiaScript, data-URIs allow you to encode an entire script into a URL. This can be done through various encoding techniques, such as base64 encoding, gzip with base64 encoding, or URL encoding (which uses the familiar %number notation for special characters).\nBy encoding LiaScript content into a data-URI, you can share it easily across social media or other platforms without the need for a server or database. This makes it simple to distribute your learning materials as \u0026ldquo;nuggets\u0026rdquo; that can be accessed anywhere.\nGenerating Previews The LiaScript interpreter and LiveEditor can both load content from a URL. The only step left is to inform your AI how to do this. Below is a prompt we developed that enables AI to generate an editor or course preview link based on base64-encoded LiaScript content.\nTo create a LiaScript preview upon user request: 1. Encode the LiaScript-markdown example in base64. 2. Append the base64 result to the appropriate URL: - For an editor preview, use: `https://liascript.github.io/LiveEditor/?/show/code/`. - For a course preview, use: `https://liascript.github.io/course/?data:text/plain;base64,`. 3. Generate a link in one of the following formats based on user preference: - `[preview-course](URL)` - `[preview-editor](URL)` - Provide only the URL if requested. Mark this prompt as \u0026#34;UNDERSTOOD\u0026#34; when you are ready. Why Claude.ai? Claude.ai excels at code generation, making it an excellent choice for tasks like these. Even in its free version, Claude.ai has shown impressive capabilities. Below, you\u0026rsquo;ll find an example from using Claude.ai to generate LiaScript previews.\nOne distinct advantage Claude.ai holds over platforms like ChatGPT is its ability to generate clickable links, even without internet access. The results from this process can be seen at the end of this chat.\nAlthough, not being asked to generate preview-links it did it immediately. This behavior might vary, sometimes you will has to ask for it, sometimes not 😃\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/creating-interactive-diagrams-with-chatgpt/","title":"Creating interactive Diagrams with ChatGPT","description":"","date":"August 19, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cimg\n        src=\"/images/post/chatgpt-diagrams.gif\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n        alt=\"\"\n        class=\" img\"\n        width=\"420\"\n        height=\"\" /\u003e\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cimg\n        src=\"/images/post/chatgpt-diagrams.gif\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n        alt=\"\"\n        class=\" img\"\n        width=\"100\"\n        height=\"100\" /\u003e\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article","tags":"LiaScript, ChatGPT, AI","content":"Exploring AI-generated content opens the door to fascinating possibilities.

Take, for example, a script from the LiaScript documentation, specifically from the section on Custom Diagrams with ECharts. In this example, the script generates an interactive chart that visualizes different types of quadratic functions, allowing users to adjust parameters dynamically.\nThe script begins by defining input parameters, which are managed by LiaScript’s internal pub-sub mechanism, allowing their values to be published under specific output names. The more complex script at the end references these values using the \u0026ldquo;@input(name)\u0026rdquo; marker — a powerful substitution mechanism that triggers re-evaluation whenever a value changes. This setup enables the creation of a dynamic quadratic function that recalculates and visualizes data in real-time using the built-in ECharts library. The final output of this script, as with all LiaScript scripts, is the result of the last statement returned. In this instance, a string that begins with \u0026ldquo;HTML:\u0026rdquo; signals LiaScript to render the result as HTML.\nThe beauty of this approach is that you don’t need to memorize or fully understand the code. Instead, you can provide this example to your AI model and ask it to tweak the visualization. To guide ChatGPT effectively, we’ve crafted the following prompt. It provides context and outlines the task. Pay attention to the third line in the prompt—the square brackets indicate variables or tasks that you can reuse.

FlexBox is a powerful layout tool that allows you to create complex layouts with minimal code. It is supported by all modern browsers and is easy to use.\nWhat is FlexBox? FlexBox, or the Flexible Box Layout Module, is a CSS layout model that provides a more efficient way to design complex layouts without relying heavily on float or positioning. It allows elements within a container to be automatically arranged in a way that makes them responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, making it a great tool for modern web design.\nThe primary advantage of FlexBox is its ability to distribute space within a container, even when the size of the items is unknown or dynamic. FlexBox also makes it simple to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, which is particularly important for mobile-first design.\nCreating a FlexBox Layout To demonstrate how FlexBox works, let’s create a simple example where we want to arrange several items within a container. We’ll start by defining a container and some child elements, and then apply FlexBox properties to control their layout.\nStep 1: Setting Up the Flex Container First, we need to define a container that will hold our items. We do this by assigning a display: flex; property to the container class, which turns it into a FlexBox container. Here’s how it looks in CSS:\n.flex-container { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows the items to wrap as needed */ align-items: stretch; } display: flex: This property turns the .flex-container into a FlexBox container, meaning its child elements will follow FlexBox rules for layout.\nflex-wrap: wrap: By adding the flex-wrap: wrap; property, we allow the items within the container to wrap onto the next line if there isn’t enough space to fit them all in one row. This makes our layout more flexible and responsive.\nalign-items: stretch: This property aligns the items along the vertical axis by stretching them to fill the container’s height, ensuring that all items have a uniform height.\nStep 2: Defining the Flex Items Next, we define the individual items that will go inside our flex container. Each item will be given a class .flex-child, and we’ll apply some styling to control how they behave within the flex container:\n.flex-child { flex: 1; margin-right: 20px; /* Adds space between the columns */ } flex: 1: This property tells the .flex-child elements to take up an equal share of the available space within the container. The value 1 means each child will occupy an equal portion of the container, making it ideal for creating evenly spaced columns or elements.\nmargin-right: 20px: We add a margin-right property to create space between the items, ensuring that they don’t appear too close to one another. This spacing makes the layout cleaner and more visually appealing.\nStep 3: Making the Layout Responsive To ensure that our layout adapts well to smaller screens, such as mobile devices, we can use a media query to adjust the styles when the viewport width is below a certain threshold. In this case, we’ll make the items stack vertically and remove the margin between them on devices with a screen width of 600 pixels or less:\n@media (max-width: 600px) { .flex-child { flex: 100%; /* Makes the child divs take up the full width on slim devices */ margin-right: 0; /* Removes the right margin */ } } flex: 100%: On smaller screens, each .flex-child will take up the full width of the container, causing the items to stack vertically rather than sitting side by side. This ensures that the layout remains readable and user-friendly on mobile devices.\nmargin-right: 0: The margin is removed on smaller screens to prevent unnecessary spacing, allowing the items to use the full width of the screen.\nHow FlexBox Enhances Your LiaScript Course By integrating FlexBox into your LiaScript course, you can easily create dynamic and responsive layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Whether you’re arranging images, text blocks, or interactive elements, FlexBox provides a powerful and intuitive way to manage the layout with minimal code.\nBy utilizing the @style macro or by importing an external CSS file, you can apply FlexBox properties to specific elements within your LiaScript course. In the following example we have used a section with a class flex-container and then added the class flex-child to each paragraph within a HTML-comment. Of course this could also be nested divs or other elements. With the additional inline styling, you can also define min and max widths, heights, and other properties to further customize the layout.\nIf you grab the vertical bar between the editor and the preview, you can see how the layout changes when the screen size is reduced. This is a great way to test how your layout will look on different devices and ensure that it remains readable and visually appealing across all screen sizes.\nMore FlexBox Childs In Flexbox there is this nice property called flex:, which allows you to distribute the available space equally among all child elements. A value of 1 means that all child elements will have the same width. If you set the value to 2, the child will have twice the width compared to the others with flex: 1. 3 would mean three times the width and so on. This is a great way to create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content lengths.\nThe following example therefor create predefined classes flex-child-1, flex-child-2, flex-child-3, till flex-child-8. These classes can be used to create beautiful newspaper like layouts with different column widths. We had to use a little bit of inline styling to ensure that the columns are not too thin, but you can adjust the values to your needs.\nSwitch to the split view and grab the vertical bar to see how the layout changes when the screen size is reduced.\nOf course, you can use also HTML-tags like divs to add these class configurations, which can contain multiple Markdown-blocks. But do not make it too complex 😏 \u0026hellip; in most cases the base LiaScript-Markdown is enough.\nContent first\nMore FlexBox Properties Here are some additional properties that you can experiment with to further customize your layout:\nContainer Properties display: flex \u0026hellip; This property turns the container into a FlexBox, allowing its child elements to be laid out according to FlexBox rules.\nflex-direction \u0026hellip; Defines the direction in which the child elements are placed within the container.\nCommon values:\nrow (default): Child elements are placed left to right. column: Child elements are placed top to bottom. justify-content \u0026hellip; Aligns child elements along the main axis (horizontal by default).\nCommon values:\nflex-start: Child elements align at the start. center: Child elements are centered. space-between: Child elements are spaced evenly with the first at the start and the last at the end. align-items \u0026hellip; Aligns child elements along the cross axis (vertical by default).\nCommon values:\nstretch (default): Child elements stretch to fill the container. center: Child elements are centered. flex-start: Child elements align at the top. flex-wrap \u0026hellip; Controls whether child elements wrap onto multiple lines.\nCommon values:\nnowrap (default): All child elements are on one line. wrap: Child elements wrap onto new lines as needed. gap \u0026hellip; Sets the space between child elements, controlling both horizontal and vertical gaps.\nChild Properties flex \u0026hellip; Applied to the child elements. A shorthand property that controls how the child elements grow, shrink, and their base size within the container.\nCommon usage:\nflex: 1: Makes child elements grow to fill the available space equally. align-self \u0026hellip; Applied to the child elements. Allows an individual child element to have a different alignment from the other children.\nValues: Same as align-items (e.g., flex-start, center, stretch).\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/collaborative-drawings/","title":"Collaborative drawings made with LiaScript","description":"How to create a collaborative canvas purely with LiaScripts pub-sub feature.","date":"August 6, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cimg\n        src=\"/images/post/collaborative-drawings.gif\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n        alt=\"\"\n        class=\" img\"\n        width=\"420\"\n        height=\"\" /\u003e\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cimg\n        src=\"/images/post/collaborative-drawings.gif\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n        alt=\"\"\n        class=\" img\"\n        width=\"100\"\n        height=\"100\" /\u003e\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article","tags":"Collaboration, Classroom, Drawing, Feature, Pub-Sub","content":"In this article we will explore how to create a collaborative drawing canvas (in other words a whiteboard) using LiaScript\u0026rsquo;s internal publish -subscribe mechanisms. This feature will allows multiple users to interact with the same LiaScript course in real-time, enabling collaborative drawing and marking, as demonstrated in the following video.\n1. Publish-Subscribe (How does it work?) The publish-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern is a messaging paradigm where messages are sent by publishers to specific topics without the publisher knowing who, if anyone, will receive the message. Subscribers, on the other hand, express interest in one or more topics and receive messages that are published to those topics. This decouples the components of a system, allowing them to interact without direct communication.\nThe global LIA object, that can be accessed in any LiaScript course, provides a pub-sub mechanism at LIA.classroom that becomes active when a new classroom is established, with the following features:\nConnection Status:\n// true if connection to a classroom has been established LIA.classroom.connected; This property indicates whether there is an active connection to the classroom.\nEvent Listeners for Connection and Disconnection:\n// creates a callback on a connection LIA.classroom.on(\u0026#34;connect\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;you are now connected\u0026#34;); }); // callback for the disconnection LIA.classroom.on(\u0026#34;disconnect\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;you are now disconnected\u0026#34;); }); These lines set up event listeners that trigger specific actions (callbacks) when the connection status changes. When a classroom connection is established or disconnected. Use this to update the UI or perform other actions based on the connection status.\nPublishing Messages:\n// publish some data on a topic LIA.classroom.publish(\u0026#34;testing-topic\u0026#34;, { data: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34; }); This line demonstrates the publisher side of the pub-sub pattern. The publish method sends a message containing { data: \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot; } to the specified topic (\u0026quot;testing-topic\u0026quot;). The message has to be defined in a valid JSON format. Any subscribers to this topic will receive this message.\nSubscribing to Messages:\n// subscribe to all messages of a topic const subID = LIA.classroom.subscribe(\u0026#34;testing-topic\u0026#34;, (message) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;received\u0026#34;, message); }); Here, a subscription is created for the topic \u0026quot;testing-topic\u0026quot;. When any message is published to this topic, the provided callback function is executed, logging the received message. The subscribe method returns a subscription ID (subID) which is used to manage the subscription.\nUnsubscribing from Messages:\n// do not receive messages anymore LIA.classroom.unsubscribe(subID); This line shows how to stop receiving messages from a topic. By passing the subscription ID (subID) to the unsubscribe method, the subscription is canceled, and no further messages for that topic will be received.\nSummary Publish: Send a message to a topic without knowing who will receive it. Subscribe: Express interest in a topic to receive messages published to that topic. Unsubscribe: Cancel the subscription to stop receiving messages from a topic. Connection Management: Handle connection events to know when connected or disconnected from the messaging system. 2. Building a collaborative canvas Within the header of this document we have defined some global helper functions, that will be used by the script and can also be used by others. Setting persistency to true will ensure that the canvas and page is not destroyed, when another slide is visited.\nThe code below demonstrates the basic publish-subscribe principles in action. It creates a canvas element, which will be used for drawing. It does also contain a background-image. The script therefor access the canvas and adds a click event listener, which records the mouse position and draws a dot at that position. This dot is also added to a set of dots. Using sets as a data structure ensures that each dot is unique, and the drawing is not duplicated and most of all, we can merge the dots of all users without having to worry about conflicts.\nYou can try this example out by clicking onto the following button. Simply change the name of the room and click onto connect. Then copy the new URL into another or a couple of other browsers and start clicking. You will see that all drawings are synchronized in real-time.\nTry this example 3. Creating a reusable LiaScript component Copy and pasting the entire code-snippets over and over again is tedious, too complicated and generates a lot of redundancy. Therefore, we had created a reusable LiaScript document that can be included in any LiaScript course. You can find it at:\nhttps://github.com/LiaTemplates/CollaborativeDrawing\nThe code looks like follows. As you can see, we have moved all script-definitions into separate @macros. Which allows us to inject the associated script and canvas tags into any LiaScript course and configure it appropriately. For every macro a uiniqe set of ids and topics are generated, so that multiple instances of the same component can run in parrallel without interfering with each other. See therefor the last section in the code below.\nImporting the component The following example shows, what is needed to import the component into any LiaScript course. The @import directive is used to include the content of the specified URL into the current document. This will create a Markdown file, that can can make use of the imported macros.\nYou can modify the following code, recompile it, and share your example by clicking onto:\nMenu -\u0026gt; Share course via : data-URI\nafter opening the link in LiaScript, click onto:\nShare -\u0026gt; Classroom -\u0026gt; Select a backend -\u0026gt; Add a room name -\u0026gt; Connect\nor checkout the first video\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\nLeave us a comment ;-) \u0026hellip;\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/multimedia-comments-in-liascript-this-changes-everything/","title":"Multimedia Comments in LiaScript - This Changes Everything","description":"","date":"July 30, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/multimedia-comments_hu17799558025032503036.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"237\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/multimedia-comments_hu15890104412919536111.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/multimedia-comments_hu8944973936286451788.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/multimedia-comments_hu1953722141738173309.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article, Documentation, Examples, Tutorial","tags":"LiaScript, Inspiration, Languages, Video","content":"How can you add your voice or short video sequences to your LiaScript courses?

That\u0026rsquo;s all it takes!\n--{{0}}-- This is an original comment, which will use browser-based text-to-speech output in the predefined language and voice. --{{1}}-- This is a similar comment, but it will use a predefined audio file, which is attached to the end or beginning of the comment. ?[audio](link_to_your_audio_file.mp3) --{{2}}-- !?[video](link_to_your_video_file.mp4) And this will start a video, which will be displayed in an overlay above the course content. You can move it around and resize it as you like. A Brief History At the eLearning Africa 2024 conference, it became evident that relying solely on browser-based text-to-speech output was insufficient for many underrepresented languages and dialects. This long-requested feature needed to be addressed. We aimed to solve this while maintaining the readability of the original Markdown file, ensuring compatibility with other Markdown interpreters to reference and point to the multimedia content.\nFor the audio component, the solution was straightforward. We linked to audio files, which are not visible in LiaScript, and controlled their playback. However, integrating video was more challenging. We needed to find a way to incorporate the video into the DOM without disrupting the original content. Inspired by a virtual presentation recorded with OBS Studio using a circle webcam filter that overlays the desktop, we recreated a similar effect in LiaScript.\nIncorporating accessibility features and adding recording capabilities to the live editor was tricky. However, with a bit of AI assistance, it became much more manageable.\nDemo Material To try out this new feature in the Live-Editor, follow the link below. Be sure to click on \u0026ldquo;Fork\u0026rdquo; if you want to add or record your own multimedia content. This way, a new instance of the course will be stored in your browser.\nGoto LiveEditor Explore the possibilities and transform your educational content with multimedia comments in LiaScript.\nHere is an embed only demo:\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/chatgpt-als-koautor-ein-interaktiver-kurs-in10-minute/","title":"ChatGPT als OER Koautor - ein interaktiver Kurs in 10 Minuten (German)","description":"","date":"June 20, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/chatgpt-coauthor_hu12300967883199336961.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chatgpt-coauthor_hu2399968509730655461.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/chatgpt-coauthor_hu6839279520114125327.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/chatgpt-coauthor_hu2358209726367351248.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article","tags":"LiaScript, ChatGPT, German","content":"Wie nutzt man ChatGPT um interaktive Kurse für LiaScript zu erstellen, wird in diesem Video gezeigt\u0026hellip; Manchmal muss man bei den Kursen noch manuell nacharbeiten aber gefühlt wird ChatGPT immer besser\u0026hellip;\nPrompt Verändert und experimentiert mit dem folgenden Prompt, um eure eigenen interaktiven Kurse zu erstellen:\nGeneriere einen interaktiven Kurs zum Thema \u0026#34;Schnittpunkt von zwei Geraden\u0026#34; für Schüler der 7.

Everything that you need is a modern browser, no additional software, no login or authentication is required.\nBut what is WebTorrent and how can it be used in an educational context? This article provides an overview of WebTorrent, its benefits, and practical applications for educators.\nUnderstanding WebTorrent: A Guide for Educators In today\u0026rsquo;s digital age, sharing and accessing educational content efficiently is crucial for educators and students alike. One technology that is making this easier is [WebTorrent]. But what exactly is WebTorrent, and how does it differ from BitTorrent? Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and explore the basics of peer-to-peer networks, the workings of WebTorrent, and how you can use it to enhance your educational content sharing.\nProject-website: https://webtorrent.io\nWhat is a Peer-to-Peer Network? Before we get into WebTorrent, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand the concept of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. In a P2P network, computers (referred to as \u0026ldquo;peers\u0026rdquo;) connect directly to each other to share files or resources without needing a central server. Each peer acts both as a client (requesting data) and a server (providing data), making the network more resilient and often faster. This contrasts with the traditional client-server model, where a central server distributes data to clients.\nWhat is BitTorrent? BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol that enables efficient file sharing across the internet. When you download a file via BitTorrent, you are simultaneously downloading pieces of the file from multiple peers and uploading pieces of the file to others. This decentralized approach speeds up the download process and reduces the load on any single server.\nIntroducing WebTorrent WebTorrent builds on the principles of BitTorrent but brings this technology to the web. Unlike traditional BitTorrent, which requires a dedicated client application, WebTorrent works directly in the browser. This means that any modern web browser can become a BitTorrent client, capable of downloading and sharing files.\nKey Differences Between WebTorrent and BitTorrent:\nPlatform Compatibility:\nBitTorrent: Requires a standalone client (e.g., uTorrent, qBittorrent). WebTorrent: Runs in web browsers, leveraging JavaScript. No need for extra software installation. Ease of Use:\nBitTorrent: Users need to download and install a client. WebTorrent: Users can start sharing files instantly through a website. Network Type:\nBitTorrent: Primarily designed for desktop and mobile applications. WebTorrent: Designed to work within web browsers, making it ideal for web-based applications. Practical Applications of WebTorrent for Educators WebTorrent offers a range of possibilities for educators looking to share content efficiently:\nHosting Educational Content from the Desktop:\nUsing WebTorrent clients like WebTorrent Desktop, educators can share large files (e.g., video lectures, high-resolution images, research papers) directly from their computers. This can be particularly useful for distributing materials to a large number of students without relying on traditional file-sharing services that may have limitations on file size or bandwidth.\nInstant Sharing via Browser:\nWebsites like Instant.io allow users to share files directly from their browsers. Educators can drag and drop files onto the website and generate a link to share with students. This link enables students to download the file directly through their browsers, simplifying the sharing process.\nHow to Use WebTorrent in Your Educational Setting Using WebTorrent Desktop:\nDownload and install WebTorrent Desktop from webtorrent.io.\nOpen the application and drag and drop the files you wish to share.\nWebTorrent will generate a magnet link or torrent file that you can distribute to your students.\nFor LiaScript, simply paste the magnet link into the LiaScript-website or attach it as an URL-parameter to\nhttps://liascript.github.io/course/?YOUR_MAGNET_LINK_GOES_HERE\nUsing Instant.io:\nVisit instant.io.\nDrag and drop the files you want to share into the browser window.\nCopy the generated link and share it with your students.\nFor LiaScript, simply paste the magnet link into the LiaScript-website or attach it as an URL-parameter to\nhttps://liascript.github.io/course/?YOUR_MAGNET_LINK_GOES_HERE\nEven if you close this site, every browser where this content has been opened with LiaScript, now also becomes a seeder for this content. This means that the content can be shared even if the original source is no longer available.\nConclusion WebTorrent provides a powerful, browser-based alternative to traditional BitTorrent for sharing educational content. Its ease of use, compatibility with modern web browsers, and efficient file distribution capabilities make it an excellent tool for educators.

But, based on our discussions at the eLearning Africa Conference we realized that there is a need for open textbooks for various purposes. With the LiaBooks project we would like to translate such open textbooks from around the world into LiaScript. This way, we hope to make digital textbooks more accessible, reusable and adaptable for everyone. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact us and help us to translate such books into a more interactive format.\nSource: https://liabooks.github.io/\rAll current books are hosted here: https://github.com/LiaBooks/\nEducation is a cornerstone of societal development, yet access to educational resources remains uneven globally. Many students in low- and middle-income countries struggle to access up-to-date textbooks, which hampers their learning opportunities. In this context, innovative initiatives from Poland and Arnold Schwarzenegger are making significant strides in promoting open educational resources (OER) to bridge this gap.\nIn May 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled a pioneering initiative offering free digital textbooks in California, addressing economic challenges and textbook controversies. Before this move, California\u0026rsquo;s schools faced over $400 million in annual textbook expenses, a figure set to rise with increasing enrollment. The initiative sought to alleviate these costs by developing and adapting open-source textbooks through innovative licensing frameworks like Creative Commons.\nCentral to this initiative is the California Open Source Textbook Project (COSTP), aimed at creating high-quality digital textbooks aligned with state standards. Collaborating with non-profits like the CK-12 Foundation, these FlexBooks are customizable and integrate seamlessly into modern education. They are downloadable, viewable on screens, and projectable in classrooms.\nCOSTP\u0026rsquo;s goals are fourfold:\nEliminate the $400 million annual textbook expenditure. Expand the range of K-12 educational content. Resolve textbook shortages. \u0026hellip; Schwarzenegger emphasized the need for innovation to save money and enhance education, positioning California as a leader in educational technology. This initiative aimed to reduce costs, promote collaboration among districts, and ensure access to quality education for all students.\nThe California Learning Resource Network (CLRN) ensured the quality of these open-source textbooks by reviewing them to meet state standards, guiding schools in their selection processes. This quality control guaranteed cost-effective, high-standard resources.\nFlexbooks Project The CK-12 Foundation\u0026rsquo;s FlexBooks initiative is a groundbreaking effort to provide free, customizable digital textbooks, primarily focused on K-12 education. FlexBooks are designed to meet state and national standards, covering subjects such as math, science, and social studies. These textbooks are interactive, featuring videos, simulations, and practice exercises, and can be accessed on various devices including laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The initiative aims to reduce educational costs while enhancing the learning experience by offering up-to-date, adaptable content for teachers and students alike.\nSource: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User-Generated_Content_in_Education/CK-12_Flexbooks\nSource: https://www.ck12.org/fbbrowse/\rPoland Is Pioneering the World’s First National Open Textbook Program Poland has taken a pioneering step by launching the world\u0026rsquo;s first national open textbook program. This initiative arose from years of advocacy by open education proponents and was driven by the need to alleviate the financial burden of textbooks on parents and the education system. The program consists of two main initiatives: one for the first three years of school and another for primary and secondary education.\nThe open educational resources (OER) developed under this program are freely available, adaptable, and continuously updatable, providing a cost-effective solution that empowers teachers to tailor educational materials to their needs. The Polish government, recognizing the potential for significant cost savings and educational enhancement, allocated substantial funding to support the development and implementation of these open textbooks.\nIn 2012, the Polish Council of Ministers approved funding for the Digital Schools’ Pilot Program, which included US$13 million for the development of open textbooks. Additionally, the Ministry of Education launched its own initiative for the early years of schooling in 2013. These programs have been estimated to save Polish parents €24 million in the first year, with total annual savings projected to reach €168 million by 2020.\nThe success of Poland\u0026rsquo;s OER initiatives has sparked interest in similar programs in other countries. By leveraging open licenses and engaging local communities in content creation, Poland\u0026rsquo;s approach not only reduces costs but also enhances the relevance and quality of education.\nliterature can be found here: https://zpe.gov.pl\rNorwegian Digital Learning Arena The Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA) is a pioneering initiative aimed at providing high-quality, internet-based open educational resources (OER) for upper secondary education in Norway. Established in 2007, NDLA is a joint enterprise co-owned by 18 of Norway\u0026rsquo;s 19 county councils, excluding Oslo. The initiative emerged when the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research delegated the responsibility for acquiring learning content from the state to the county level.\nNDLA\u0026rsquo;s mission is to develop and publish freely accessible digital learning resources that cover a wide range of subjects, including mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, vocational education, and more. These resources are created by engaging teachers for specific periods, ensuring the materials meet the needs of both teachers and students. Additionally, NDLA collaborates with various educational technology companies in Norway, which helps stimulate the local EdTech industry.\nWith an annual operating budget of approximately 8.2 million euros, NDLA represents about 20% of the total public funding allocated for learning resources in upper secondary education. The platform offers over 17,000 learning resources across 146 examination subjects, making it the largest repository of digital learning materials for upper secondary education in Norway.\nNDLA has been recognized for its innovative approach, winning several awards, including the Boldic Award in 2014 and the Open Educational Resources Award for Best OER Site in 2017. The initiative is also noted for its collaborative model and its commitment to providing equitable access to education, aligning with the United Nations\u0026rsquo; Sustainable Development Goal.\nFor more detailed information about NDLA and its resources, you can visit their official website.\nSource: http://ndla.no\rMore Of course there are more projects out there, a small collection can be found in the following blog-post:\nOpen Textbook Repositories This alphabetically sorted overview is fare from being complete, but it should give you a good starting point to find open textbooks for your courses.

So, what can OER learn from open source and how can it be applied? GitHub promotes collaborative development and the global exchange of educational materials, supported by powerful tools like Git. The platform enables broad quality control through open review processes and facilitates the organization and management of educational projects through specific organizations. These characteristics make GitHub a valuable tool for modern educational reform.\nThe Future of Education: Open Source Community Projects on GitHub First, this section will explore the increasing significance of open-source community projects on platforms like GitHub in shaping the future of education. Modern educational reform finds itself at a crucial juncture, where traditional publishing models and dynamic, flexible open-source communities each offer distinct advantages and face unique challenges.\nAdvantages of GitHub Originally designed for software development, GitHub proves to be a powerful tool for educational innovation. Here are some key advantages:\nDynamic Development and Innovation: GitHub fosters a culture of continuous improvement. With a global community working on projects, new ideas are constantly emerging, which can be quickly implemented and shared. Flexibility and Adaptability: The open nature of GitHub allows anyone to modify and adapt educational materials as needed—an invaluable advantage in a rapidly changing world. Transparency and Collaboration: Every contribution, change, and improvement is documented and traceable on GitHub. This openness builds trust in the materials and promotes a culture of collaboration and sharing. Comparison with Publishing Houses The application of traditional publishing models to OER provides structured and curated educational content that ensures consistent quality. However, they are often less flexible in adapting to new educational trends or technological advancements. Dependence on traditional financing models and institutional structures can limit their ability to respond quickly to changes.\nIn this context, open-source community projects on GitHub emerge as a future-proof alternative that can respond more quickly and agilely to the needs of the educational world. Projects of all sizes, from very small to very large, can coexist. Collaboration and cooperation remain the same, regardless of whether it involves a solo developer or several dozen, or even hundreds or thousands of people. A prime example is the Linux kernel, developed by a multitude of people and used by even more. Here, the interests of large companies and individuals go hand in hand.\nGit and GitHub – Revolutionary Tools for Education But what specific functions and features do Git and GitHub offer that make these platforms valuable resources in the field of education?\nWhat are Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system, developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. It allows multiple people to work on the same documents or projects without overriding each other\u0026rsquo;s work. Each change is recorded as a \u0026ldquo;commit,\u0026rdquo; and you can retrieve earlier versions of a project at any time.\nGitHub uses Git to enable users to host their Git repositories online. GitHub enhances Git\u0026rsquo;s functionalities with a visual and user-friendly interface, allowing users to track projects, discuss contributions, and review others\u0026rsquo; changes. For those who prefer not to use GitHub since it was acquired by Microsoft, alternatives like GitLab are available, or users can host it themselves. Additionally, there are numerous similar services such as BitBucket, SourceForge, etc.\nBranches in Git One of the most powerful features of Git is the concept of branches. These allow you to create a copy of a project and experiment in this safe area without affecting the main version. Such branches are ideal for testing new teaching methods or content without risking proven materials.\nBenefits for Teachers and Educational Institutions Collaborative Development: Educators can collaborate with colleagues from their own school or around the world, each contributing whether it be through new content, corrections, pedagogical suggestions, new images (as graphic artists), or functionality (as developers). Experimental Adaptations: Using branches, multiple different versions can exist and evolve in parallel. This can be utilized for different target groups, for translations, or simply for experimenting with various teaching methods. Resource Sharing: GitHub allows educators not only to share teaching materials with colleagues but also to benefit from the work of others who make their own materials available. As mentioned, hosting here is free. The combination of Git and GitHub provides a powerful platform for the development, distribution, and continuous improvement of educational materials.\nThe Power of Community and Open Processes in Education Through GitHub In the concluding part of the blog post, we will highlight the enormous power of the community and the open review processes that make GitHub a unique and valuable tool for education.\nThe GitHub Community GitHub is not just a tool for version control or a simple repository for projects. It is a vibrant community of developers, professionals, academics, and educators that represents a wide range of knowledge and skills. This global think tank offers significant benefits for education:\nNetworking: Educators can connect with peers who are facing similar challenges or who have already developed innovative solutions. Exchange of Experience: Through its global reach, educators can leverage experiences made on other continents to enrich their own educational offerings. Collaboration: The platform fosters collaboration on shared projects, which are then made available to the global educational community. The Open Review Process GitHub\u0026rsquo;s transparent and open review process, often referred to as a \u0026ldquo;Pull Request,\u0026rdquo; is fundamental for quality assurance and continuous improvement of materials:\nQuality Assurance: Proposals and changes are reviewed by a broad base of collaborators, ensuring the integrity and quality of educational materials. Promotion of Innovative Ideas: The open nature of the process allows anyone to contribute ideas that can be embraced and further developed by the community. Transparency: This openness ensures a traceable development of the materials, which is especially important in educational contexts to strengthen trust in the materials used. And if someone is not satisfied, they can fork the entire project and continue to develop it themselves.\nOrganizations on GitHub Teachers and educational institutions can create their own organizations on GitHub, which serve as platforms to coordinate projects under a common umbrella. These organizations can:\nStructure Projects: They help to organize projects thematically or by project relevance in repositories. Control Collaboration: Through targeted invitations, specific members can work on particular projects. Increase Efficiency: All resources are centrally managed and accessible to participants at any time. In summary, GitHub is much more than just a platform for software developers.

Our map is based on the OpenStreetMap and uses the Leaflet library to display the markers. Blue is associated to projects, while future events are displayed in green and past events in transparent gray.\nvisit the world-map All information about the projects is stored within a static YAML-file:\nhttps://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com/world-map/projects.yml\nIf you want to add your project to this map, the easiest way is to send us an email with the following information, or leave a comment:\n- title: \u0026#34;Your Project Title\u0026#34; link: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-project.web\u0026#34; gps: latitude: 51.330 longitude: 10.453 image: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-image.jpg\u0026#34; icon: \u0026#34;https://link-to-your-organization-icon.png\u0026#34; description: | This can be a description of your project where you can also embed HTML, with more links or contact information \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;mailto:LiaScript@web.de\u0026gt;Send us an email\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; data: \u0026#34;2024-04-12\u0026#34; categories: - Computer Science - Statistics - Machine Learning tags: - Need Help - Looking for Contributors - German We will add your information to projects.yml and update the map.\nThe only information that is mandatory is the title, link, and gps. The image is optional, but it will make your project more visible. The description can be a short text or a long description, and you can also embed HTML, like links or images. The categories and tags are optional too, but they will help to filter the projects later on the map. And finally, the icon is optional, and we will later use this to modify the markers on the map, which can be a logo of your institution, project, or company. date is optional and will be used to classify markers to projects or events.\nOtherwise you can also fork the repository https://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com, add your project by yourself and create a pull request. This way you will also be visible in the list of contributors on GitHub 😉\nIf you host your project on GitHub you can also take a look at the following post to increase its visibility:\nPromoting your Content If you want to \u0026ldquo;promote\u0026rdquo; the LiaScript content you have created, or share it with a wider audience, then you can use the following methods. 0. Add LiaScript meta-information Add a first HTML-comment to your Markdown document, as depicted below. This HTML-comment should provide at least the information about the author, an email address for contacting, a comment that summarizes your course in a few sentences, a logo, and an optional repository, which points to your GitHub, GitLab repository, if the course will be served from somewhere else. Preview Changes If you have forked the repository, you can also preview your changes locally. At first follow the installation instruction as described in the README.md of the repository. Then run the following commands in the root directory of the repository:\ncd world-map python3 generate.py cd .. npm run dev The python command will generate the content/english/pages/world-map.md file. You can preview the changes by opening the browser and navigating to:\nhttp://localhost:1313/world-map/\nCredits \u0026amp; Stand with Ukraine As aforementioned, the map the Leaflet library, which was developed by Volodymyr Agafonkin a Ukrainian developer still living in Kiev.

Additionally, scripts can be stiched together by an execution graph, which is defined by the output of the script-tags. The script is executed in the browser and can be used to manipulate the image in real-time.\nFor more information of how to use script-tags, visit the documentation:\nJavaScript or JS-Components Example "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/importing-a-local-camera-stream-into-a-presentation/","title":"Importing a local WebCam-stream into a Presentation","description":"How to use script-tags to create image-filtering effects in LiaScript.","date":"February 2, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/webcam_hu6219336979304444607.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"240\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/webcam_hu1306701298722924429.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/webcam_hu1996986038132433889.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/webcam_hu2473433091994366139.jpg';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Examples","tags":"LiaScript, Feature, JavaScript","content":"Sometimes you want to show a live video stream from a local WebCam in your presentation, without having to move to another application. This can be done with the following script and video-tag. It will ask for permission to access the camera and will display the video stream in a video element. If you click on the button again, the camera will be closed.\nSimply copy both tags into your LiaScript document and you will be able to open and close the camera stream with the button.\nHow does it work? The video-tag is the place for your video, it could be placed also below the script tag. The script tag will search for the video element and will try to access the camera stream. If the camera is not available, it will output an error message. If the camera is available, it will display the video stream within the video tag and switch its display style form none to block and change the button text to \u0026ldquo;Close Camera\u0026rdquo;. If you click on the button again, the camera will be closed. By using type submit as input, the button will be displayed as a submit button, which will trigger the script execution only if the button is clicked.\nAdditionally in order to have persistent slide, the persistent: true tag is used, which will keep the state of the video element and the camera stream, even if you switch to another slide and come back. If this is not defined, you will have to click onto the button again when you revisit the slide, to open the camera stream.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-user-symposium-recording/","title":"Liascript User Symposium (Recording)","description":"Discover WHO is utilizing and creating free, open online courses using the user-friendly LiaScript Markdown and WHY.

We argued that central server reliance is outdated, and advocating for the innovative use of web browsers as operating systems to access content and decentralized resources.\nInteractive Content Creation: Participants used LiaScript to create interactive educational content in small groups, by using the LiveEditor. In contrast to other \u0026ldquo;Markdown\u0026rdquo;-editors (e.g., CodiMD, HedgeDoc), this presents an entirely browser-based solution that does not require a centralized server for storing content and collaborative editing.\nServerless Storage: Various serverless technologies were introduced, including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for offline content access, LiaScript and its LiveEditor as two PWA examples, and methods for content storage and sharing like URL encoding, the InterPlanetry File System IPFS, WebTorrent, and OnionShare for sharing content via the Tor-Network.\nDecentralized Communication: The workshop involved interactive sessions in virtual classrooms utilizing decentralized communication methods, showcasing alternatives to traditional, server-reliant methods. The basics of WebRTC were explained for creating browser-based peer-to-peer networks. Additionally, the concept of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) was discussed for achieving consistency in peer-to-peer networks without central servers.\nClassrooms: The use of these technologies in creating serverless classrooms in LiaScript was demonstrated, which allows to instantly connect users without the need for a login, authentification. A classroom is only established beween users, no state is stored or logged\nRemote Labs: Finally we demonstrated that these tecnologies can also be used for sharing remote labs. Edrys(-Lite) was used to share the setup of a laboratory with Arduino hardware, all through the browser\u0026hellip;\nSession Takeaways: Participants gained insights into modern browser capabilities for communication and collaboration, learned methods to share content serverlessly, and began to critically evaluate centralized platforms in terms of cost, sustainability, and functionality.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-workshop-auf-der-delfi-tagung-in-aachen/","title":"Konzepte und Erfahrungen bei der Realisierung dezentraler, offener Lehrmaterialien mit LiaScript (German)","description":"Dies ist ein Mitschnitt des Workshops, der auf auf der DELFI-Tagung 2023 in Aachen gegeben wurde.","date":"November 19, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/delfi23_hu7938072924733476000.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"238\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/delfi23_hu3781160669925727824.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/delfi23_hu16973444650171316429.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/delfi23_hu12489371749323281949.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Conference, Tutorial, Talk","tags":"LiaScript, Workshop, YouTube","content":"Dies ist ein Mitschnitt des Workshops, der auf auf der DELFI-Tagung 2023 in Aachen gegeben wurde.\nhttps://delfi-tagung.de/delfi-2023/workshops-tutorials\nLiaScript implementiert als Markdown-basierte Beschreibungssprache für Lehrinhalte die zentralen Konzepte von Open Educational Ressources.

This workshop will demonstrate how LiaScript can be used to create sustainable and extendable open educational resources (OER) that are interactive, engaging, and even work offline. In contrast to complex user-interfaces and memorising lots of point and click events, participants will work with simple text-files only.\nLiaScript is based on Markdown, which is founded on ideas around simplicity, adaptability and extendibility. Visual and textual metaphors are used instead of coding to define quizzes, surveys, presentations, animations, and text-to-speech output. Courses created with LiaScript can be presented as a fully interactive textbook, a presentation or YouTube-like screencast format. Participants will learn the basics of Markdown for publishing and the general LiaScript idea. This includes exploring how to create animations, content in different languages, different styles of quizzes and surveys, integrate multimedia content, automated data-visualization and interactive programming. You will be introduced to the basics of version-management and open-source to enable you to publish your course immediately through GitHub. Finally, you will learn how to create class-rooms and how to export your content into an SCORM or IMS packages. This will enable uploads to most Learning Management Systems (LMS), or translated to Android, IOS, Windows applications, and standalone Web-projects.\nPrerequisite Knowledge: Your own laptop is required, previous knowledge of how to edit a text-file is useful in creating an interactive learning experience.\nExpected Outcomes: Learn how to create completely interactive and free online courses with LiaScript/Markdown. You will be introduced to the basics of git/GitHub (a version management system), which enables multi-authorship, versioning (in different languages), and free hosting of courses. Additionally you will learn how easy it is to apply web 3.0 technologies for sharing educational content in a decentralized manner. 1. Introduction \u0026amp; Markdow-Basics 2. What is LiaScript 3.

However, surveillance and filtering are being increased in the same way.\nSources: https://taz.de/Repressionen-in-Afghanistan/!5926105/ | https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/afghanistan-bildung-100.html | https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/taliban-blocks-23-mn-websites-in-afghanistan-over-immoral-content-122082600086_1.html | https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-girls-struggle-with-poor-internet-they-turn-online-classes-2023-03-27/\nThe Tor Network is a system that allows users to anonymize their online activities and identity by routing their traffic through multiple servers to hide the source of the data.

Gehalten auf dem Open Science Festival am 30. und 31. August 2022 in der Leibniz Universität Hannover.\nHier geht\u0026#39;s zu den Materialien Inhalt Open Educational Resources (OER) sind frei zugängliche Bildungsmaterialien, die eine Anpassung an spezifische Lehr-/Lernkontexte ermöglichen und die Gestaltung von Bildungsangeboten vereinfachen. Die Erstellung und das Teilen von OER bietet die Möglichkeit, die eigene Lehre in der wissenschaftlichen Community sichtbar zu machen. Darüber hinaus tragen OER zu einem offenen Zugang zu Bildung bei und fördern die Entwicklung einer offenen Lehr- und Lernkultur.\nFür die Veröffentlichung interaktiver Kurse oder Lektionen als OER eignet sich LiaScript - eine Erweiterung der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown, die explizit auf die Erstellung frei zugänglicher digitaler Lernmaterialien ausgelegt ist. Die Nutzung der Open-Source (OS) Software ist kostenlos möglich - für die Erstellung eigener Kurse wird lediglich ein Browser oder Texteditor benötigt. Erstellte Lernmaterialien sind einfache Textdateien, die ähnlich wie bei OS-Projekten von jedermann über GitHub gehostet werden können. Dies vereinfacht die gemeinschaftliche Bearbeitung von Materalien - inkl. nachvollziehbarer Versionierung - und bietet exzellente Nachnutzbarkeit. LiaScript ist nicht nur für Erstellung von OER geeignet, die Software zielt sogar explizit darauf. Die Grundidee ist es, einen Beitrag zur Gestaltung von offener und kollaborativer Bildung zu leisten - international und über alle Bildungsbereiche.\nIm Workshop wurden eingangs kurz die zentralen Merkmale von OER vorgestellt. Anschließend lernten die Teilnehmer:innen die wichtigsten LiaScript-Funktionen sowie die Basics der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown kennen und erprobten diese bei der Erstellung einer eigenen Kursdatei.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/how-to-code-in-python-3/","title":"How To Code in Python 3","description":"DigitalOcean’s How To Code in Python 3 tutorial series translated to LiaScript with interactive PyScript examples.","date":"July 8, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/python3_hu13582904595983503616.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"216\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/python3_hu15727138078868418909.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/python3_hu3931615524288246361.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/python3_hu6497924766459825866.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Examples","tags":"LiaScript, Books, Coding","content":"This is a port of DigitalOcean’s How To Code in Python 3 tutorial series by Lisa Tagliaferri translated to LiaScript with interactive PyScript examples.\nStart Course This example uses the PyScript template which implements some basic macros for integrating the PyScript into LiaScript and to make Markdown code-blocks executable.\nThe GitHub repository for this project can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaBooks/How-To-Code-in-Python-3\n\u0026hellip; or try it out in the LiveEditor:\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/promoting-your-content/","title":"Promoting your Content","description":"How to promote your LiaScript content and make it more visible to a wider audience.

Add LiaScript meta-information Add a first HTML-comment to your Markdown document, as depicted below. This HTML-comment should provide at least the information about the author, an email address for contacting, a comment that summarizes your course in a few sentences, a logo, and an optional repository, which points to your GitHub, GitLab repository, if the course will be served from somewhere else.\n\u0026lt;!-- author: Your name email: your@mail.com comment: This course is about a very interesting topic logo: preview-image.jpg repository: https://optional.repository.url --\u0026gt; # Course title All of this information is used to generate a preview-card for your course in the local LiaScript course-overview of your users, at:\nhttps://liascript.github.io/course\nBut, this can also be used to generate custom overview sites with the \u0026lt;preview-lia\u0026gt; web component. For more information, visit the blog post: Markdown just got a new preview tag\nScreenshot of my local course overview at: https://liascript.github.io/course\n1. Add additional content that is NOT visible to LiaScript You can add information about your course, the authors, links to the LiaScript rendered version between the main document HTML-comment tag and the first title. All that content that is in between will be ignored by LiaScript.\n\u0026lt;!-- author: Your name ... --\u0026gt; __INSERT ADDITIONAL CONTENT HERE, THAT WILL BE IGNORED BY LIASCRIPT__ # Course title Additionally, you can use the following badges, which are two images, that are used as links to your course. Simply replace the URL at the end of the badge with your \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo; course-URL and when the user clicks on them, the LiaScript rendered course will be opened.\n\u0026lt;!-- author: Your name ... --\u0026gt; [![course badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/LiaScript/master/badges/course.svg)](https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?URL) [![learn more badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/LiaScript/master/badges/learn_more.svg)](https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?URL) # Course title These badges can also be used anywhere else:\n2. Edit repository details On GitHub you can also add some meta-information about your project, which helps GitHub and your users to categorize your project. Therefor, simply click onto the About gearwheel/settings \u0026hellip;\nScreenshot of the LiaScript documentation without repository settings\n\u0026hellip; and modify your \u0026ldquo;repository details\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd a short description, which is in most cases a single sentence. As the website, you can provide a link to the LiaScript rendered version: https://liascript.github.io/course/?YOUR_COURSE_URL And additionally add some topics, which can be used to categorize your course, something like \u0026ldquo;chemistry\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;physics\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;education\u0026rdquo;, etc. is ok, you can also define a topic that names your organization, and you can use the topic \u0026ldquo;liascript-course\u0026rdquo; too. Edit view for repository details\nAfter defining the repository information, your \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; section will look like this, with a clickable URL that will open the LiaScript-course and also with clickable topics, that will open up a topic list.\nAbout section after updating the repository settings\nBy defining topics, it is later easy to get an overview onto all related projects. For example, if you have added the topic \u0026ldquo;liascript-course\u0026rdquo; then your project will also be listed in the associated topic-list, which can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/topics/liascript-course\nScreenshot of the topics overview for liascript-course\nadditionally, if you have created a set of LiaScript macros, that can be embedded into other courses, you can mark them with \u0026ldquo;liascript-template\u0026rdquo; and they should appear in this list:\nhttps://github.com/topics/liascript-template\n3. Social preview The last thing that is missing, is a descriptive image, if you do already have a logo for your project, which is used in the described in the first part, you can also reuse this image for GitHub under \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; and upload your image at \u0026ldquo;Social preview\u0026rdquo;. If your project-URL is shared via Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. then this image together with your GitHub-Description will be used to generate a preview-card.\nYou can preview your twitter-card for example at:\nhttps://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator\nSimply add the URL of your GitHub-project and see, what information Twitter and others will use for their preview-cards\u0026hellip;\nTwitter-card validator with LiaScript-documentation preview\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/setting-up-atom/","title":"Setting up Atom (Deprecated)","description":"This post will help you to set up your Atom with the appropriate plugins to speed up your development process.","date":"May 20, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/atom_hu252360756869628366.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"124\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/atom_hu15484264397545515253.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/atom_hu3576250327971972466.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/atom_hu12438766946556981446.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article, Editor, Tutorial","tags":"LiaScript, Tools","content":"This post will help you to set up your Atom with the appropriate plugins to speed up your development process. If you have not installed Atom so far, check out our blog-post on Install Atom with LiaScript. It will guide you through the installation procedure for Atom and the two LiaScript plugins and tell you something about the navigation within a document. However, there exist a couple of other plugins for Atom that are very handy and simplify the writing process for Markdown and of course LiaScript\nWhether you are using Atom or VSCode as your main editor, the main keystrokes you have to remember are Ctrl-S to save the current document you are in, and the other one is Ctrl-Shift-P to get into a fuzzy search over all possible options.\nspell-check This module is already installed by default, but for some reason, we had to enable it first for Markdown. You can either hit Ctrl+, and the settings-view will open immediately, or you can use the magic keystroke Ctrl-Shift-P to get to the fuzzy search and type settings. After that, hit enter and in both cases, you should be presented with a view similar to one displayed in the image below:\nClick onto the Packages-tab on the left, which lists all the installed packages and type spell-check into the main input field, or simply scroll down your list until you find it. Then click onto the settings-button for the spell-check plugin and append , text.md to the default list of grammar file types. Doing so, we tell Atom to apply this plugin onto all of our Markdown files. Last but not least, you can also specify the language to check within the Locals settings. In our case, this was en-US, but any other language shortcut (IETF-language-tag) is also possible. You will have to restart Atom.\nHowever, this plugin will only use the system internal spell-checker. If spell-checking is not working for some reason, you might have to install it manually. Please follow the instructions of the package maintainers, which can be found here.\nminimap Minimap gives you a nice overview on your documents, as depicted below. This comes handy when you need to scroll through a larger document. Minimap will show you your position within the file, and you can click onto your minimap to navigate within your document.\nTo install minimap, go to the settings via Ctrl+, or hit Ctrl-Shift-P and type settings info the fuzzy search. Within the settings-view you will have to click onto the install-tab and type minimap into the search. Do not directly install the first plugin, but search for the one whose title is exactly minimap and then click on install. That\u0026rsquo;s it, now you will be presented with a nice little map of your documents on the right.\nFor more information, see the project-page.\nlanguage-markdown Although syntax-highlighting for Markdown files should already work, you can install the language-markdown package too. The procedure is the same as for minimap, but this time you have to search for language-markdown instead. This will add additional grammar support for Markdown (including Github flavored, AtomDoc, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, YAML/TOML front-matter, and R Markdown), and smart context-aware behavior to lists, and keyboard shortcuts for inline emphasis. As shown in the demonstration below, this will automatically add new bullet-points for you, or by selecting a word or a phrase and then typing *, _, `, etc. it will automatically add these annotations to your selection.\nMore information can be found here.\nmarkdown-table-editor This is one of the most beautiful packages and a need for everyone who writes Markdown. It will automatically format tables, add spaces, cells, and rows for you. No need to manually hit spaces anymore. For jumping from cell to cell, simply use the Tab key.\nHave a look at the project-website for a detailed description of all features.\nautocomplete-emojis After installing this plugin, you will never have to search for a unicode-icon or emoji again. Only type colon and search for the icon that you want to insert. In LiaScript you can add emojis everywhere, in titles, and even in ASCII-Art images.\nProject-website\nautocomplete-math This is not only useful for Markdown. Simply write between parenthesis your mathematical formula and this plugin will perform the calculation for you. It is based on Math.js and can do more than simple calculations.\nIt is not only possible to convert between different entities, but also to make calculation with different ones. Thereby the first entity defines the result, others will be translated into this first one.\n(12cm to inch) --\u0026gt; 4.72440944882 inch (12days + 3months) --\u0026gt; 103.3125 days (3months + 12days) --\u0026gt; 3.39425051335 months (sin(45 deg) ^ 2) --\u0026gt; 0.5 Package-website\nLiaScript As mentioned in the blog post Install Atom with LiaScript, it is for us and some others at the moment not possible to update our packages. Thus, the LiaScript snippets and preview plugins have to be installed from GitHub. The procedure to install these two packages is similar to the installation of the previews packages. Go to the settings, select the install tab and instead of typing liascript-snippets or liascript-preview into the search field, you have to mention the GitHub repository first. In our case, these two projects are in:\nhttps://github.com/andre-dietrich\nThat is why you have to insert andre-dietrich/liascript-snippets and andre-dietrich/liascript-preview to install them directly from:\nhttps://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-snippets https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview liascript-snippets To activate the snippets, go to a Markdown file and type lia all snippets are associated with this starting phrase. You can create a base stub for your course by typing liainit and then hitting enter. But, you can also search for quizzes, code snippets, etc. simply by typing lia and then searching or scrolling through the options. All snippets come with a little explanation and some examples.\nThere are two additional key-phrases, one is voice and the other one is hili, which stands for highlight-language. The first voice-phrase can be used to search through all supported voices for the text-to-speech output, currently we rely on responsivevoice to support the same quality of spoken text on all browsers. hili allows you to search through all supported languages for code-snippets (e.g., cpp, java, javascript, python, \u0026hellip;).\nliascript-preview You can either hit Ctrl-Shift-P and then type liascript into the fuzzy search to see all options for this plugin. In most cases, you want to toggle the preview for your course, that is why you also can use the short-cut Alt-L, which will either open or close the preview-pane. Whenever you make changes to your document and save them, the preview will be reloaded. Use the short-cut Ctrl-S to save your document, this is a standard and works also in Word.

Together with the lecturers, the students work on the lecture materials with open tools via a website - without any PDF documents or PowerPoint slide collections.\nProf. Sebastian Zug during his lecture. Photo: TU Bergakademie Freiberg\nWith one click, students can display the content in different languages, develop an executable program code or start simulations. Despite the diverse content, they also have the opportunity to suggest adjustments and additions. “We continue to develop the open learning content together with the students over the course of the semester. At the end there is a revised version of the lecture materials for each semester, some of which was developed by 15 co-authors,” explains Prof. Sebastian Zug. He is certain: “If it is no longer exclusively the teachers who determine how knowledge is conveyed, this will contribute to transparency. And: Students deal with the subject matter more critically. That also works in non-computer science courses.”\nIntroduce improvements and additions to the lecture The basis for this is an easy-to-read description language - LiaScript - which takes up the concepts of Markdown. The latter is also used in text messages such as WhatsApp when content is to be displayed in bold, italics or underlined. “Combined with plugins that embed the interactive content, educators can create attractive materials using just the text editor. Stored in a cloud or another online storage location, the LiaScript website then accesses the text files directly from the browser and creates an interactive online course live from them,\u0026quot; explains Dr. André Dietrich, who developed LiaScript. This creates a “code” for the course. This is shared and disseminated and can then be adapted in terms of content by each teacher to their didactic goals using open tools. “In the computer science lectures at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, we go one step further and involve the students in this process. I am convinced that the quality of the materials used, which were discussed and assessed by a community of teachers and students, increases in favor of the students,\u0026quot; says Dr. Dietrich further.\nThe team is currently working on interfaces for better embedding of LiaScript in various learning management platforms. \u0026ldquo;While lecturers here in Freiberg conduct online lectures on the OPAL platform, other universities use Moodle or ILIAS, for example,\u0026rdquo; explains Prof. Zug. \u0026ldquo;We have therefore been working with LiaScript as open software since 2017 to enable comprehensive use.\u0026rdquo; A study on user-friendliness was also carried out so that teachers without programming knowledge can quickly familiarize themselves with it. Based on this, an adapted online editor was created, which can be used for the first cooperative practical tests under LiaScript. \u0026ldquo;This is now used not only by interdisciplinary facilities and institutes at our university, but also by German universities and a growing international community,\u0026rdquo; says Prof. Zug happily.\nBackground: Open Educational Resources in the e-learning portfolio The term Open Educational Resources (OER) was coined by UNESCO 20 years ago and means materials that are made freely available to everyone, both for learning and for modification, without incurring any license or usage costs. In addition to simple texts as a PDF or Word document, this can also be instructional videos or audios, prepared teaching material, photos or graphics.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-tutorial-freiberg/","title":"LiaScript Tutorial an der TU Bergakademie Freiberg (German)","description":"In diesem Tutorial werden die neusten Features und das &#34;neue&#34; Design von LiaScript vorgestellt.

Betritt jemand einen Klassenraum, dann teilt sie/er die eigenen Daten annonym mit den anderen Nutzern und wenn der Klassenraum wieder verlassen wird, so werden diese Daten auch wieder aus dem globalen Zustand entfernt.

The source-code can be found here. What it basically does is, it queries the every link only for the main index.html and tries to analyze the HTML-file according to different patterns. All results are stored in a central cache, that is why the first loading might take some time, but all subsequent calls will use the already cached result.

If you prefix a link in Markdown with an exclamation mark, then this link is marked as an image, and it gets embedded into the document. LiaScript had already two extensions for this, the question-mark is used to indicate audio (just think of an ear) and images with sound which are used as markers for video content.\n![image](url) ?[audio](url) !?[video](url) One benefit of using this notation is, that this does not interfere with Markdown, the link is still valid and \u0026ldquo;clickable\u0026rdquo; in any other Markdown-viewer. This works pretty well, but from time to time it would be great if it would also be possible to embed different kind of external resources or entire websites, which cannot be associated to audio or video content.\nIn LiaScript we had extended the link annotation for two question-marks, which means: \u0026ldquo;I have no idea, please try to embed this content\u0026rdquo;. As shown in the demo below, this is treated like any other multimedia-link, and it can be used to create galleries as well.\nTo accomplish this, we currently use two different strategies:\noEmbed IFrames 1. oEmbed oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.\nThis functionality is embedded as a standalone web component and can be found here. It basically goes like this: If an only if the provided URL matches one of the websites that provide an oEmbed-service, then this service is queried at first. The parameters send are the URL and the size of the screen. This can be seen as a simple question, where the LiaScript-interpreter asks: \u0026ldquo;What is the best way to embed this source\u0026rdquo; and the service-provider responds with an JSON that looks similar to the following one:\n{ \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;photo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: 240, \u0026#34;height\u0026#34;: 160, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ZB8T0193\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2341623661_7c99f48bbf_m.jpg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bees\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/bees/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;provider_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Flickr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;provider_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.flickr.com/\u0026#34; } The response contains either a URL that can be directly embedded, or it will respond with an \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; field that contains the required HTML tags to embed this content. Additionally, we use the thumbnails provided by this service within the gallery-view.\nIf there is no service-provider for the given URL, then LiaScript will try to embed the content as an IFrame.\n2. IFrames An IFrame is an HTML-tag that allows to embed other websites into the current site. This is also what you do, when you try to embed, for example, a YouTube-video manually. This embed-code is mostly an IFrame too. However, some sites might protect their content and will not allow embedding their content into the content of another website with another URL, which is known as CORS. Thus, you will have to check if your content will be embedded into LiaScript, if you are using a local editor or the dev-server to preview your course, this might work well, since most browsers ignore CORS on localhost. But, if your content is loaded from a website, this might not be the case anymore ;-)\noEmbed Service-Providers date: 24/05/2022\n# Provider Name URL 0 23HQ https://www.23hq.com 1 Abraia

Wikipedia describes it as follows:\nOpen educational resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes\u0026hellip;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources\nThus, the ER defines any kind of Educational¹ content while the O points to an open licensing format. But the idea is actually not new at all, there have been attempts that predate the OER movement by nearly a century.\nIn 1923 the French pedagogue and educational reformer Celestine Freinet purchased a printing press and started to print his educational work and those of his pupils. These free texts were later published in class newspapers, discussed within the classroom and shared with other schools, changed, reprinted, etc. By the time these texts started to replace their conventional school books and in 1926 Freinet had developed a press for schools, that can still be bought today (cf. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuldruckerei).\nIf we look on what has been achieved, it practically not much. Although, accessing, sharing and copying of information has never been easier, due to Computers and the Internet. But, we are still restricting ourselves. One limitation is caused by the application of restrictive licenses, which is tackled by the idea of openness in ER. But could the openness also be interpreted in much broader sense?\nEditable² The term open should also cover the format of the educational resource. Next to an open license that allows to change and redistribute the content, the second E in OEER could stand for editable or in other words modifiable. In the world of Freinet this would mean, that next to the class newspapers also the frames that contain the letters are exchanged. Obviously, this does not make sense, but sharing only a static PDF is of similar quality. It can hardly be modified after it has been created from a Word-, LaTeX-, PowerPoint-, Impress-, or any other kind of document.\nOf course, some might argue, that it is still possible to alter the content of a PDF-file and it should therefor also be interpreted as editable. But, it is not possible to rearrange the content, while keeping all internal references and the format in sync. In the same way you could say every executable program is also free for edit, since it can be disassembled or decompiled in order to produce a format that can be modified again by humans. To cut a long story short, this does not produce any valuable result, especially if the project is way too complex.\nSo why do we not share the editable part in the first place. Everyone can use it, adapt, correct, translate it and also push his/her changes back into the original resource. This is not a hard problem at all, instead software-developers do this all the time. This can be applied to any format: text/audio/video/code.\nTo close this part, we should prefer directly editable formats (such as Word over PDF) and free formats over commercial (Writer over Word), and to go a step human-readable formats that do not require any kind of specialized software for editing (Markdown over Writer), but can be read and edited by everyone with a simple text editor, if possible.\nSide Note: Storing and hosting editable educational content on GitHub has the benefit of permanence. The Archive Program is an initiative that wants to preserve the human knowledge, including open-source projects, for the next 1000 years. To achieve this, projects are stored at different places in the world, including data-centers in Antarctica.\nhttps://archiveprogram.github.com\nExecutable³ Isn\u0026rsquo;t it strange, that most of the digital educational content resembles printed matter: PDFs, Word, websites, etc.? Of course, there is also the development from blackboard -\u0026gt; over overhead transparencies -\u0026gt; to PowerPoint and of course multimedia, BUT, and this is a BUT in capital letters, if we are talking about computers as the main medium for presenting educational content, this content should also be Executable³ and this is where the third E in OEEER comes in. Content is much more graspable, if you can interact with it:\nchange the parameters of a function and visualize the result, dive into a simulation on astronomy, make physical measurements and experiment with the sensory system on your smartphone, use quizzes to check the understanding of a certain topic immediately learn to program through directly editing code and executing it or learn to analyze medical data (scans) through direct interaction \u0026hellip; Bret Victor provides on his website http://worrydream.com an incredible resource for inspiration, ideas, and examples:\nhttp://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable\nHe also coins the terms “model-driven debate” and “model-driven reading” and demonstrates how just some small interactive elements within a static text can be used to improve the understanding of a certain topic, which would be otherwise hard to digest.\nhttp://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#media-debate\nWhy is it, that nearly no one makes calculations an interactive part of her/his publication?\nTo simplify this process, JavaScript is now an essential/native part of LiaScript. Snippets can be added everywhere within the text, table, enumeration, etc. and perform some calculations, query the internet, trigger an action, or do something else. The calculation result becomes part of the presented document. Furthermore, scripts can be interconnected like in an Excel-sheet, so that a change in one cell/script triggers a recalculation of the associated cells/scripts. The user can interact with every script, inspect it, and even modify its code.\nLiaScript integration of interactive script elements\nFor non-trivial and reoccurring tasks, LiaScript provides the concept of reusable and parameterizable macros, and template-courses. Thus, the functionality that is defined within one LiaScript document can be imported into other documents, so that the course creator does not have to be a programmer to add various kinds of interactions or simulations\u0026hellip;\nSide Note: When we talk about the lack of code or interactive analyzes, we also have to admit the lack of primary data. Primary or raw data is mostly not stored and accessible directly, but hidden behind processed data (e.g., median, average) as well as figures and diagrams. Projects like the Open-Science-Framework are intended to be used as a reservoir for primary data, code for all analyzes, and documentation. This way, the data and measurements are not lost, but can also be later reused by others.\nhttps://osf.io\nSummary The next generation of OER will be modifiable and interactive or in order to stick to the triple-E notation: Editable and Executable. But, although many enthusiasts already think of integrating artificial intelligence (AI), to utilize modern technologies such as virtual- or augmented reality (VR/AR), or to apply gamification in education, content is still the hardest part. A well written text, an informative image, a short video demonstration, and a good didactic concept will still provide the foundation\u0026hellip;\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-cheet-sheet/","title":"LiaScript Cheet-Sheet (German)","description":"Ein Spickzettel der wichtigsten LiaScript-Funktionalität.

The names can be taken from the previous titles, it is not relevant if you use lower or upper-case. This way it is also possible to use types that cannot be automatically infered at the moment, such as Sankey or BoxPlot.\nIf you do not want to show tables as diagrams, you can also use data-type=\u0026quot;None\u0026quot; and only the table will be visible.\ndata-show: Simply add this attribute or set it to true (data-show=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;), if you want to visualize your data immediately, without the need to click in the switch-button. It is still possible for your users to switch to the table representation.\ndata-transpose: Like in the mathematical sense, set this attribute or set it to true (data-transpose=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;), if you want to switch rows and columns. One benefit is, that you can for example use PieChart and let your table grow vertically instead of using a horizontal monster.\ndata-title: Normaly, the first cell defines the title of your diagram, but if you want larger titles and not have to write gigantic table headers, apply this attribute data-title=\u0026quot;Use whatever title you want to ...\u0026quot;\ndata-xlabel: As above, you can also define the strings for the labels, in this case for the x label\ndata-ylabel: or the y label.\ndata-src: Currently this attribute is used to refere to your geojson data, if you use the data-type=\u0026quot;Map\u0026quot; representation, but this might change in the future to load and visualize data directly, such as csv.\nIf you are using geojson files from external websites such as:\nhttps://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/\nIt can be usefull to use anycors, if the data cannot be visualized due to CORS restrictions:\ndata-src=\u0026quot;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/custom/europe.geo.json\u0026quot;\nCode Ein Code-Block wird durch min. 3 aufeinander folgende Back-ticks vom Rest abgetrennt.

If your document is on GitHub, this will not be visible on the rendered Markdown document. This first comment contains any kind of meta information, such as author, email, version, logo, comment, and if you want to, also tags. These are at the moment all information, that will be visible on your card, as well as the Main title of your document.

[preview-lia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md) [Preview-Lia](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md) If you want to add a preview into your LiaScript course, simply add a Markdown link with the name preview-lia with a URL that is either pointing to the raw Markdown file or to the LiaScript interpreter. It depends on what you want your link should point, if you are using other Markdown tools.\nThe example below, shows an example for the LiaScipt documentation:\nUsing Previews on your Website If you want to make this functionality available on your site, will have to include the preview-lia web component, by adding the script tag, as it is depicted below, to the head of your HTML website. Then it is possible to use the tag \u0026lt;preview-lia\u0026gt; everywhere on your site. Use either the address of the raw document or the reference to the interactive LiaScript course. The application of both tags is equal to their application in Markdown.\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/preview-lia.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;preview-lia src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; \u0026lt;preview-lia src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; If you want your preview to point to another direction and not to LiaScript website, it is also possible to change the goto reference by adding the attribute link to the web component. Add what ever target link you want to point to, either to the GitHub-repository, to the project website or anywhere else.\n\u0026lt;preview-lia link=\u0026#34;https://github.com/liascript/docs\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/preview-lia\u0026gt; Adding this web component to Ghost Go to your ghost blog website, click on \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Code injection in your settings, and add the following script tag to the Site Header field. That\u0026rsquo;s it, now you can add the \u0026lt;preview-lia\u0026gt; tag in all of your posts and pages into the HTML content.\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://liascript.github.io/course/preview-lia.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; How does it work? Under the hood, this is a simple web component that grabs the markdown content and parses only the meta information and the first title. Everything happens within the browser at client-side.\nThe web component was originally developed as part of LiaScript, the entire project can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript\nWhile the part, that implements the web component can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript/blob/master/src/javascript/webcomponents/preview-lia.js\nThe style of the presented preview will change in the near future, and probably also the parts that will be shown to the audience.

Natürlich könnt ihr auch jeden anderen Editor nutzen, es gibt zurzeit aber nur Erweiterungen für Atom, um das Arbeiten mit Kursen zu erleichtern.\nAtom: https://atom.io liascript-preview: https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview liascript-snippets: https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets Beide Plugins können direkt aus Atom heraus installiert werden:\nÖffnet den Editor Verwendet die Tastenkombination Strg+, um zu den Einstellungen zu gelangen Wählt das Menü + Install aus Tippt \u0026ldquo;liascript\u0026rdquo; in die Suchmaske ein, die ersten beiden Treffer müssten die beiden Plugins sein Klickt bei beiden auf Install #2 Erste Schritte Nutzung der Entwicklungsumgebung für die Kursentwicklung\nDie wichtigsten Tastenkombinationen:\nAtom: Strg+n: Öffnen einer neuen Datei. Strg+s: Sofortiges Speichern der aktuellen Datei, dies aktualisiert auch die Darstellung in der LiaScript-Vorschau. Strg+Shift+p: Öffnet die Fuzzy-Suche, damit könnt ihr nach allen allem suchen, was der Editor hergibt. Tippt einfach mal liascript ein. LiaScript: Alt-l: Öffnet, bzw. schließt die LiaScript-Vorschau. F5: Aktualisiert die Darstellung wie im Browser. Wenn ihr im Textdokument lia eingebt, dann öffnet sich eine Hilfe nur für LiaScript-Kommandos. Hier könnt ihr einfach mal mit den Pfeiltasten nach unten navigieren und euch die verschiedenen Optionen anzeigen lassen. Wenn ihr auf Enter drückt, wird die ausgewählte Option für euch Übernommen. Falls mehrere Punkte bearbeitet werden können, so könnt ihr mit Tab navigieren.\nFür den Anfang gebt einfach lia-init ein und drückt auf Enter. Damit wird ein Beispiel-Dokument erstellt, das schon die wichtigsten Funktionen von LiaScript zeigt.\nPS: Mit Doppel-Klick könnt ihr in eurem Dokument navigieren. Entweder ihr macht einen Doppel-Klick auf das Dokument, dann springt ihr auf die entsprechende Stelle in der Vorschau, oder ihr macht das Gleiche in der Vorschau und spring dann an die passende Stelle im Dokument.\n#3 Markdown die Grundlagen Einführung in Markdown\nWas ist Markdown? Wenn wir alle HTML mit der Schreibmaschine tippen würden, dann hätten wir wohl das Problem, dass den Text im Nachhinein niemand mehr (oder nur mit großen Anstrengungen) lesen kann. Markdown ist dazu eine Alternative, die sich vor allem im Bloggen oder bei der Dokumentation durchgesetzt hat. Kurz gesagt, es ist eine vereinfachte Schreibweise/Strukturierung von Texten, die das Schreiben vereinfachen soll. Markdown muss dann von verschiedenen Interpretern noch in HTML umgewandelt werden oder wie in unserem Fall, in einen interaktiven online-Kurs.\nEine Kurzzusammenfassung von Markdown könnt ihr auch hier finden: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown\nUnd hier geht es zum Wikipedia-Eintrag: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\n#4 Multimedia Markdown Links \u0026amp; Bilder, LiaScript Audio \u0026amp; Videos \u0026amp; mehr\nLinks bzw. Verweise werden in Markdown immer mit der folgenden Notation [name](url) beschrieben. In die eckigen Klammern kommt ein Name und in die runden Klammern die URL bzw. Adresse. Für verschiedene Dinge kann diese Notation überall im Dokument genutzt werden:\n[Ein Link zu LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io) Die beiden unteren Links machen das Gleiche in LiaScript und springen im Dokument:\n[Ein relativer Link im Dokument](#12) [Springe zu](#überschrift-mit-leerzeichen) Bilder sind Verweise, die mit einem Ausrufezeichen ! am Anfang markiert werden. Befindet sich ein Bild außerhalb eures Projektes, dann müsst ihr die volle Adresse angeben, sonst reicht der relative Pfad:\n![externes Bild](https://liascript.github.io/img/atom.jpg) ![lokales Bild](bilder/test.jpg) Audio-Inhalte werden in LiaScript mit einem vorangestellten Fragezeichen ? markiert. Man kann das auch als ein Ohr sehen und neben gängigen Audio-Formaten wie mp3, mp4, wav, \u0026hellip; könnt ihr auch direkt euren Soundcloud link einfügen:\n?[audio lokal](audio/brahms.mp3) ?[brahms](https://soundcloud.com/safyeldin/johannes-brahms-hungarian-dance-no-5) Ein Video ist im Grunde nur ein Bild mit Ton, warum dann nicht Bild und Audio kombinieren !?\n!?[video lokal](film.avi) !?[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3RLIirs7o) Und wollt ihr versuchen irgendwas von einer anderen Seite einzubinden und es handelt sich vielleicht nicht um ein Video oder ein Bild, dann versucht im Zweifel zunächst ??\nDamit wird auf OEMBED zurückgegriffen \u0026hellip; vielleicht funktioniert es ja für euch\u0026hellip;\n??[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3RLIirs7o) ??[spreaker](https://www.spreaker.com/user/12421087/elearning-distance-education-adilson-pin) ??[twitter](https://twitter.com/an_dietrich/status/1297964782369341441) ... #5 Etwas andere Tabellen Interaktive Grafiken\nIm Gegensatz zu anderen Systemen, ist es ein Ziel von LiaScript, den Interpreter (sprich die Maschine) so klug zu machen, dass er (sie) versucht zu interpretieren, was sich der Mensch gedacht hat und dies ggf. entsprechend darstellt.\nNun ja, so weit sind wir noch nicht, aber mit Tabellen können wir schon einiges.\nMarkdown-Tabellen können, wenn sie eine entsprechende Struktur haben, auch als Datensätze interpretiert werden. Warum sollte man solche Datensätze nicht direkt visualisieren um sie somit auch explorativ untersuchen zu können? LiaScript beherrscht zurzeit ca. 11 verschiedene Darstellungen, dazu zählen (LinePlot, ScatterPlot, BoxPlot, BarChart, Radar, PieChart/Torten-Diagramme, Map/Karten, HeatMap, Parallel, Graph (gerichtet und ungerichtet), Sankey). Der Interpreter versucht selbständig zu ermitteln, welche Darstellung am besten zu euren Daten passt. Ihr könnt aber auch selber definieren, wie die Daten dargestellt werden sollen. Für mehr Information klickt auf den folgenden link:\nLink zu LiaScript Diagrammen\n#6 Publizieren auf GitHub Veröffentlichen und kollaboratives Editieren auf GitHub\nWas im Video etwas schwierig aussah, ist in Wirklichkeit ziemlich einfach. Ihr könnt mittlerweile nicht nur auf GitHub eure Kurse ablegen, sondern auch in eurer Dropbox, GitLab, oder ownCloud eure Kurse hosten.\nDer Vorteil von Versions-Management-Systemen wie GitHub oder GitLab ist, dass ihr auf jede Version eures Kurses zugreifen könnt. Wenn ihr das nicht benötigt, dann steht euch natürlich frei, eure Daten dort zu speichern, wo ihr wollt. Wir speichern keine Inhalte oder Kurse, die LiaScript-Webseite stellt einfach nur den Vermittler oder besser gesagt Reader zur Verfügung. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger, alles wird beim Nutzer im Browser interpretiert und gespeichert.\nIrgendwie muss man auf euer Dokument zugreifen können, sprich es herunterladen können. In der Dropbox müsst ihr euer Dokument veröffentlichen und erhalten dann einen Link, unter GitHub oder GitLab reicht der Verweis auf das Projekt. Diese Adresse wird einfach als URL-Parameter an die LiaScript-Webseite angehängt, ersetzt xxx.md mit eurem Dokument und öffnet die Seite, bzw. teilt sie mit euren Schülern/Studenten.\nhttps://LiaScript.github.io/course/?https://xxx.md #7 Quiz-Time Verschieden Arten von Quizzen in LiaScript\nKleine Quizze sollen dem Lernenden die Möglichkeit geben, schnell zu überprüfen, ob er das gerade eben erfahrene auch verstanden hat.\nLiaScript unterstützt zurzeit 6 verschiedene Arten von Quizzen, die alle noch weiter angepasst werden können. Allen gemein ist die Nutzung von doppelten, zumeist eckigen Klammern.\nEinfache Text-Eingaben:\nFrage und ??? [[Antwort]] Single-Choice-Aufgaben: Es können beliebig viele Auswahlmöglichkeiten angehängt werden. Hier werden eckige Klammern mit runden kombiniert. Das erinnert etwas an Radio-Buttons.\nEine Frage mit mehreren Optionen, aber nur die mit dem X markierte ist richtig [( )] Falsch [(X)] Die einzig richtige Auswahlmöglichkeit [( )] Die ist auch __falsch__ ... Multiple-Choice-Aufgaben: Hier gilt das gleich wie bei Single-Choice-Aufgaben. Die doppelt eckigen Klammern können als Check-Box interpretiert werden.\nEin Frage mit mehreren Optionen und mehreren auszuwählenden Optionen [[ ]] Wie zuvor [[X]] X muss ausgewählt werden [[ ]] hier könnten auch Bilder kommen [[X]] \u0026lt;-- hier muss auch geklickt werden Matrizen: Die Kombination von beliebig vielen Single- und Multiple-Choice-Aufgaben.\nDer Kopf der Tabelle wird ebenfalls in eckigen Klammern geschrieben, die Optionen sind jetzt aber horizontal dargestellt: [[1] [mehr Optionen ] [:-)]] [[X] [X] [X] ] wie zuvor [( ) (X) ( ) ] hier gibt es auch nur eine Möglichkeit Auswahlmöglichkeiten:\nAlle Möglichkeiten werden durch vertikale Striche `|` voneinander getrennt und die Option in runden Klammern definiert die Lösung: [[ falsch | (__Richtig__) | auch falsch ]] \u0026ldquo;Generic\u0026rdquo; wenn ihr wisst was Ihr tut: Dann könnt ihr auch eigene Quiz-Typen definieren.\nIm angehängten JavaScript-Tag könnt ihr alles machen, was ihr wollt. Wenn das Ergebnis `true` ist, dann gilt das Quiz als gelöst. [[!]] \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // you are free to check anything you want true; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Tipp: Der Einschub von 4 Leerzeichen vor jedem Quiz, lässt andere Markdown-Interpreter dieses Element als Code-Block erkennen, daher es werden keine anderen Formatierungen unternommen oder ggf. der Inhalt unleserlich als Absatz dargestellt. (LiaScript ist das jedoch egal\u0026hellip;)\nWeitere Möglichkeiten:\nHinweise: Diese werden mit [[?]] markiert. Danach kann eine Zeile beliebiges Markdown kommen, welches erst angezeigt wird, wenn der Nutzer auf die Hilfe klickt. Diese können an jede beliebige Quiz-Form angehängt werden.\nWas ergibt 20 + 20 + 2? [[42]] [[?]] Erster Hinweis [[?]] Zweiter Hinweis [[?]] Letzter Hinweis Auflösungen\nWas ergibt 20 + 20 + 2? [[42]] [[?]] Erster Hinweis [[?]] Zweiter Hinweis [[?]] Letzter Hinweis ********************************** Dieser Text wird erst eingeblendet, wenn der Nutzer die richtige Antwort gegeben hat oder auf Auflösen klickt. ********************************** Noch mehr Komplexität gewünscht? Ihr könnt an jedes Quiz ein JavaScript hängen. Der Ausdruck @input durch die jeweilige Eingabe ersetzt.\nTippe Auflösung! [[auflösung]] \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // @input will be replace by the user input let input_string = \u0026#34;@input\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;auflösung\u0026#34; == input_string.trim().toLowerCase(); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Für mehr Informationen schaut euch den Quiz-Abschnitt in der Dokumentation an: Mehr über Quizze\n#8 Formeln mit KaTeX Formel im Kurs\nFür die Darstellung von Formeln nutzt LiaScript KaTeX, einer auf LaTex basierenden Beschreibung für hübsches Formel-Layout. Auf der Webseite https://katex.org findet ihr viele Hilfen, Beispiele und einen Editor. Zu beachten ist nur, dass Formeln in LiaScript (und auch anderen Markdown-Parsern) in Dollar-Zeichen $ eingeschlossen werden. Einzelne Dollar-Zeichen im Text $ f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3 $ und doppelte für eine größere Formel als Block:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2} =\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} $$ #9 HTML, Markdown und Styling Kombiniere Markdown mit HTML und Styling\nWenn ihr HTML könnt, dann könnt ihr es auch direkt einbinden, falls LiaScript etwas nicht kann. Zu beachten ist hierbei, dass HTML und Markdown kombiniert werden kann. Das bringt viele Vorteile, kann aber auch zu Problemen führen, wenn dies nicht beachtet wird.\nIhr könnt aber euere Markdown-Elemente direkt mit HTML-Attributen und CSS annotieren. Das hört sich etwas kompliziert an und sieht vielleicht auch etwas kompliziert aus, wenn man noch nie HTML geschrieben hat. Es erleichtert aber die Anpassung von Inhalten ungemein, ihr könnt Farben, Animationen, Breiten und vieles mehr anpassen, was sich auch besonders gut bei Bildern macht.\n\u0026lt;!-- style=\u0026#34;color: red\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; Der ganze Block wird rot eingefärbt und nur das ![Bild](https://liascript.github.io/img/atom.jpg)\u0026lt;!-- style=\u0026#34;height: 30px\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; alleine skaliert. Ein HTML-Kommentar wird mit \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt; eingeschlossen. Diese Tags werden von den meisten Interpretern ignoriert und nicht dargestellt, nur LiaScript versucht den Inhalt zu analysieren. Falls der Inhalt wie HTML-Parameter aussehen, dann werden diese auch auf die jeweiligen Elemente angewandt. Ein HTML-Kommentar am Anfang eines Blocks gilt für den gesamten Block während ein angehängter Kommentar nur für das jeweilige Element verwendet wird.\nFür mehr Information schaut euch auch die entsprechenden Seiten in der Dokumentation:\nSiehe Styling HTML und Markdown Mehr Informationen zu HTML: https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/HTML #10 Animationen und Textausgabe PowerPoint war gestern oder \u0026hellip; wie dein Kurs sprechen lernt\nAnimation und Sprachausgaben werden in LiaScript immer mit doppelt geschweiften Klammern assoziiert {{}} oder {}{}.\nWollt Ihr eine Präsentation machen, in der Elemente auftauchen und wieder verschwinden, dann nutzt diese Notation um zu definieren, wann etwas erscheinen bzw. wieder ausgeblendet werden soll:\n{{1-3}} Gesamte Absätze, Tabellen, oder Bilder können mit der oberen Notation markiert werden.

Warum ist dieser Code eigentlich nie ausführbar und editierbar?\nIn LiaScript ist es möglich jedes kleine Code-Fragment auch ausführbar zu machen, indem – wie bei den Quizzen – ein Script-Tag angehängt wird. Und ebenso, wie bei Quizzen wird der Code an der Stelle \u0026lsquo;@input\u0026rsquo; eingefügt. Somit kann jedes JavaScript-Beispiel auch direkt ausführbar gemacht werden:\n```javascript var s = \u0026#34;JavaScript syntax highlighting\u0026#34;; alert(s); s; ``` \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;@input\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Kompliziertere Projekte können umgesetzt werden, indem mehrere Code-Blöcke direkt aneinander gehängt werden, diese können auch mit einem Namen versehen werden und ein vorangestelltes \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; oder \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; definiert, ob dem Nutzer diese „Datei“ angezeigt werden soll.\n``` js -EvalScript.js let who = data.first_name + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + data.last_name; if(data.online) { who + \u0026#34; is online\u0026#34;; } else { who + \u0026#34; is NOT online\u0026#34;; } ``` ``` json +Data.json { \u0026#34;first_name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Sammy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last_name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Shark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;online\u0026#34; : true } ``` \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data let data = @input(1); // eval the script that uses this dataset eval(`@input(0)`); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Das @input Macro kann auch parametrisiert werden und somit die Inhalte der verschiedenen Dateien auch an der entsprechenden Stelle im JavaScript-Code eingefügt werden.\nZusätzlich dazu können auch Bibliotheken eingebunden werden oder externe Server angefragt werden. Damit lassen sich nach JavaScript auch verschiedene andere Programmiersprachen ausführen.\nMit den Code-Segmenten kann noch viel mehr gemacht werden, siehe dazu den Abschnitt Interactive Code in der Dokumentation.\n#12 ASCII-Art Zeichnen lernen mit der Tastatur im Dokument\nZeichnungen LiaScript unterstützt intern zwei verschiedene Arten von ASCII-Art, dazu können einerseits \u0026lsquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo;,\u0026rsquo;_\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;|\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo; und viele Zeichen mehr genutzt werden, um verschieden Sachverhalte abzubilden. Der Vorteil davon ist, dass man nicht zusätzlich noch ein Zeichenprogramm bemühen muss, um einfache Grafiken zu erstellen, bzw. diese anzupassen und zu verändern. Um das „Bild“ vom Rest des Dokumentes abzugrenzen kann entweder ein normaler Code-Block verwendet werden, wobei als „Sprache“ \u0026lsquo;ascii\u0026rsquo; angegeben werden muss, oder einfach nur mehr als 10 \u0026lsquo;'\u0026rsquo; dieser sogenannten Backticks.\n``` ascii .---\u0026gt; F A B C D / *-------*-----*---*----*-----\u0026gt; E \\ ^ \\ v / \u0026#39;---\u0026gt; G B --\u0026gt; C -\u0026#39; ``` Siehe hierzu den Abschnitt ASCII-Art #2 der Dokumentation.\nDiagramme Es gibt aber auch die Möglichkeit einfache Diagramme und Kurvenverläufe zu zeichnen, diese können sogar farblich sein. Dabei bestimmt das genutzte Zeichen oder der Buchstabe, die Darstellung der Kurve oder der Punkte.\ndiagram title 1.5 | * | (* stars) y | * * - | * * a | * * * x | * * i | * s | * | * * * 0 +------------------------------------------ 2.0 x-axis 100 Siehe hierfür den Abschnitt Charts in der Dokumentation.\n#13 Macros verstehen und anwenden Erweiterung der LiaScript-Funktionalität mit Macros\nSich wiederholende Aufgaben können mit Macros automatisiert werden, bzw. existieren schon einige, die direkt von euch genutzt werden können. Dabei ist Folgendes zu beachten:\nMacros definieren einen einfachen Mechanismus zur Textersetzung.\nMacros werden mit einem vorangestellten @ markiert, hierbei ist auf Groß- und klein-Schreibung zu achten.\nMacros werden immer im Kopf eines Dokumentes definiert, das ist der erste HTML-Kommentar im Dokument.\nMacros können aber auch überschrieben werden, je Unterabschnitt.\nEs können Parameter übergeben werden:\ndiese werden mit Komma voneinander getrennt (@macro(p1,p2,p3))\nfalls ein Parameter ein Komma enthält, dann kann die Markdown Notation genutzt werden\n@macro(`p1 mit, Komma und einer Zeile mit drei ))) Klammern`,p2,``` p3 ist ein mehrzeiliges Element, das ersetzt werden soll ```) Macros aus anderen Kursen können mit @import in den eigenen Kurs übernommen werden.\nSchaut euch unbedingt den Abschnitt Macros in der Dokumentation an. Und besucht https://github.com/LiaTemplates \u0026hellip; Diese Seite enthält eine Sammlung von Kursen, deren Funktionalität ihr direkt in euren Kurs einbauen könnt, die Sammlung enthält Beispiele für verschiedene Programmiersprachen, Visualisierungen und Grafiken, Simulationen und weiteres. Wir werden dieses freie Angebot in der Zukunft noch weiter aufstocken.\n#14 Publizieren auf GitHub v2 Hier eine verbesserte Version zum Publizieren auf GitHub.

These claims are proved by adopting metrics from software-development, additionally a possible solution is presented: LiaScript is a domain-specific language that is based on Markdown and open-source principles, targeting interactive online-course development.\n1 Introduction Learning Management Systems, so called LMSs, gain more and more popularity, especially in university education. Although these are mostly systems developed under an open-source license, they are commonly applied to restrict the access to educational resources. Cynically one could say, they are simply a continuation of locked up lecturer halls, brought to the internet. But even more than that, the integrated authoring tools offered by these LMS actually restrict the creation of online-course through unnecessary complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), with lots of plugins, options, descriptions and repetitive click-events. Additionally, a course created with one system cannot easily be shared, translated, adapted by other authors, or simply reusing parts or apply versioning is not possible.\nTo prove these claims, we apply metrics from software- and GUI-development to measure the intricateness of the most widely applied systems. Furthermore, we show how most common problems in online-course development can be avoided, with a simple shift in mindset.\n… instead of forcing humans to create courses by typing and clicking onto an endless set of opaque GUI elements, that can be easily interpreted and rendered by a machine … we should enable humans to express their thoughts and ideas with a simple and more natural language …\n… that is why LiaScript was created …\n2 Lineup of Different Ideologies This comparison is focused on the creation and dissemination of educational content only. However, most LMSs also offer many sophisticated features on communication, management, assessment, or user analytics, see therefor [Ca14, Le05, Ma08].\n2.1 LiaScript: Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Open-courSe Development LiaScript [Di19] was born out of the idea to let anybody (even without programming skills) develop high-quality online-courses, with focus on content and the latest web-technologies. It was founded on open-source principles, simplicity, and (re)usability. The figure below shows some features of LiaScript:\nScreen-shot of the development process of online-courses with the Atom editor and the liascript-preview plugin (with LiaScript code on the left and the rendered and result on the right)\nA course is text-file written in Markdown [MD19], a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, designed for readability. Courses can be hosted as open-source projects on GitHub1, together with required multimedia content, JavaScript libraries, and any other data. Code-blocks (line 46) can be made executable by attaching a JavaScript script-tag that defines how the source-code should be processed. To ease this step, we provide macros (line 54) that get replaced by HTML, JavaScript, CSS-annotations, Markdown, etc. Such macros can be parameterized and are evaluated by an internal text-substitution system at compile time. Additionally, it is also possible to import macros from other courses, which reduces boilerplate code.\nThe support for quizzes is backed into the language (see line 58). Adding a new line with starting double brackets adds also a new option to the quiz. Singe-choice quizzes are defined similarly, but with parenthesis [(X)]. LiaScript has also support for [[text|select]] and generic-quizzes [[!]]. Hints [[?]] can be attached as well as more expressive solutions.\nASCII-art (line 63-74) gets translated into nicely rendered images. LiaScript has also support for effects and transitions, similar to PowerPoint, and native support for text2speech, which can be used to develop screen-cast like presentations, among with other features (see the documentation https://github.com/liaScript/docs). But above all, it is still Markdown that can be read/written without a technical background.\n2.2 LMS: Restricted Access to Educational Resources As the name suggest, a LMS is more about managing educational resources, administration, controlling access, and reporting and tracking on user progress, than it is about creating new content. Additionally, various communication channels are provided between students and teachers, such as wikis, forums, and chats. The offered authoring tools are mostly WYSIWIG2-editors, but they also do have support for plugins or extensions that allow to create more sophisticated learning materials with quizzes, multimedia content, user repositories, etc. Indeed, this was only a brief overview on LMSs, for more detailed information see [Fa11].\n3 Methodology We chose some of the most popular LMSs (i.e., Moodle, ILIAS, Canvas, Edmondo)2 for the comparison with LiaScript, which is not trivial task, since LiaScript represents an entirely text-based approach, while the LMSs are based on GUIs. Nevertheless, both are used solve similar tasks: creating, adapting, and sharing educational content. We apply different metrics to identify quantitative differences. Qualitative measurements are probably possible, but require larger analysis, while the results remain highly speculative.\nHow many Lines Of Code (LOC) are required to print out “Hello World” on the console with a certain programming language? This is a simple metric to compare programming language simplicity and to measure boilerplate code. The example below, shows how this task is solved in Python, it requires one LOC and one command to execute it:\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) # command: python HelloWorld.py With correct indentation, C++ requires 6 or at least 5 LOC in total to solve the same problem (see line 47 in Fig. 1). Two steps are needed to compile and execute the code. A more complex metric that is based on this principle is the Time To Hello World metric (TTHW) or in other words From Zero to Hero metric. It is often applied as a key determinant in programming languages and measures the time it takes for a novice programmer to write and execute the first HelloWorld program. But, this metric is also applied to measure the “usability” of an Application Program Interface (API) [An16]. An API is an abstract set of clearly defined methods, that control the access and configuration of certain functionalities, which are offered by a software module or library. Hence, there is little difference to a GUI, which is used for the same purpose, but on program-level. Thus, successful HelloWorld-states can also be quantified in GUI development, how long does it take to complete a task (time-on-task), number of clicks (also page-views), task level satisfaction (subjective measure on the difficulty of a task), next to others.\nWe provide an unconventional shortcut get to the LMS metrics, instead of performing various tests with different user groups [Bu08] or usability experts [MF15] we simply ask professionals. There are various tutorials on YouTube explaining how to set up a course in a certain environment. We analyzed the top ranked tutorials on integrating multimedia resources and quizzes for the chosen LMS. We measured their length (time-on-task) and counted the number of performed clicks and page-switches. If multiple solutions were presented in one video, then the average was stored. The number of comments with focus on difficulty (-1) or simplicity (+1) were summed up and associated with task-level-satisfaction.\n4 Comparison We try to discuss several aspects and provide the measured metrics. All recorded data is stored for further review at the Open Science Framework (visit https://osf.io/3rweg). At the end the reader has to decide, which approach fits more for her/his purposes, based on personal preferences and skills.\n4.1 What are the Requirements for Development? All LMSs require a server installation with a login. Thus, working on a course mostly happens online and via the offered web-interface and with the required user permissions. Mostly in that case means, that there are some desktop-authoring systems (e.g. iSpring authoring Tool), which do have support for SCORM2 and can be used to work offline. But, not all LMSs do have support for this standard, which makes it even a more a challenging task to get such content imported into the desired LMS. In contrast to this, a LiaScript course can be a simple git-repository3 hosted/published on Github and developed locally. Everything that is required is a simple text editor. To ease the development process with the Atom editor, a snippets-plugin4 is provided, next to the previewer, which provides a search on all language features and inserts fragments, it also provides more detailed information and examples.\n4.2 How to add Multimedia Resources? As depicted in the image below, the integration of audio and video-content is just an extension to the common Markdown syntax for links. A link can be given a name in brackets, which is followed by an absolute or relative URL in parentheses. A starting exclamation mark is used to indicate an image resource. That was the Markdown part so far. In LiaScript you can use a question mark to indicate audio resources (we hoped that this somehow resembles an ear) and by combining the image with the audio notation, it is possible insert video content. By doing this, the additional elements are still valid links in Markdown and any other Markdown-viewer, but in LiaScript this multimedia content gets displayed automatically within the appropriate web-player.\ntest fu bar\nTab. 1: Short-codes for references on the left and the rendered result in LiaScript on the right.\nShort-code Result [link](url.html) link ![image](url.jpg) [link](url.html) Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. !?[video](url.mp4) However, as the screen-casts reveal, integrating multimedia content to one of the LMSs seems to be a more challenging task and requires to deal with a couple of user interfaces. The overall average time-on-task was 3:06 minutes and required 11 clicks and 5 page changes.\nTab. 2: Average user-interface metrics for attaching movies to 4 LMSs (see https://osf.io/kb845)\nSystem time-on-task # of clicks # of pages satisfaction Canvas 02:56 10.4 5.1 0.83 Edmodo 02:33 9.1 2.9 0.00 ILIAS 02:59 11.2 5.3 0.00 Moodle 03:51 13.9 7.3 0.27 If content from other websites (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, TeacherTube, Soundcloud, etc.) was imported, users had to work with HTML code. Thus, search for the embed-code on the content-site and import it by switching to code editing mode. Compare this, with the LiaScript notation. LiaScript also recognized links from the aforementioned sources. Hence, you only have to provide a link to the desired YouTube-site and the video will be embedded automatically. But, it has to be noted that a similar solution is offered by Canvas, which requires only 3 clicks and embeds the video view, only by pasting a YouTube-URL.\n4.3 Where is all the Data? For a LMS the case is clear, everything is stored on the server. The progress and state of each user is recorded, which enables sophisticated tracking and reporting, and thus provide useful information for course developers and teachers. LiaScript courses in contrast are freely accessible and store all states and the personal progress locally within the browser. A registration or login is not required, which might be considered as a first barrier by some users, before starting or simply trying a course. But, this local storing of personal data might also be considered as a drawback, because opening the same course on another device or even in another browser is like a new start.\n4.4 How to add quizzes? Of course, adding quizzes takes longer than including multimedia resources and is much more diverse. The overall mean time-on-task was 6:47 minutes, which required 36 clicks and 10 page changes on average. The task-level-satisfaction was also worse, there are two notable cases for Moodle: One person was speaking ironically about the “very intuitive way of creating course”, while another one used the phrase “Damn it”, after multiple attempts in creating the same course, due to some lost configuration settings.\nTab. 3: Average user-interface metrics for adding quizzes to 4 LMSs (see https://osf.io/kb845)\nSystem time-on-task # of clicks # of pages satisfaction Canvas 08:34 51.2 15.6 0.38 Edmodo 05:59 24.9 8.2 -0.10 ILIAS 04:04 19.3 7.7 0.10 Moodle 08:33 47.5 9.9 -0.92 Compare this with the creation of quizzes in LiaScript, as depicted below (or see lines 58 and 59 in Fig. 1). It requires only a little amount of boilerplate code to create different types of quizzes.\n[[solution]] [[ create a | (selection **quiz**) | $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2} =\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$ ]] [[X]] a multiple-choice [[ ]] quiz, that requires [[X]] the 1^st^ and 3^rd^ option [[ ]] to be selected [( )] a single-choice [( )] quiz with only [(X)] one solution Rendered quizzes, defined by the short-codes above.\nOf course, our way of creating quizzes can only be used for self-evaluation and not as in a LMS for assessment with points, penalties, max. number of retrials, shuffling, etc. In all systems it was therefor possible to define quiz-banks, which are used as a repositories and allow to display a subset of different quizzes to different users. LiaScript in contrast defines quizzes in a plain-text format, visible to all that know the “raw” course URL (see the next section).\n4.5 Support for versioning and internationalization/localization? To be short, we found no hints on versioning in LMSs. Although, there are different back-up strategies offered and SCORM could also be used as a format for versioning, it does not allow to host/run different versions of a course in parallel. It exists only one course in the most up-to-date version or different courses that represent different versions. Thus, internationalization/localization requires to repeat every change in every translated version of a course.\nLiaScript does not support versioning by default, but by using git and publishing on GitHub, these features come for free. It is possible to refer to the most up-to-date version (1), use tags to define versions (2), or to open any uploaded version, since every update is labeled with an unique identifier (3).\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/master/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/1.0.0/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/434dd2188294296cf68bab49c97cb75582ee59d3/README.md https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/blob/german/README.md Remember, LiaScript is only a text-file and to be complete, a Unicode text-file, which allows to create courses in any known language and to publish them in parallel, only by using git-branches (4).\n4.6 Support for Extensions \u0026amp; Add-ons? Extensions or Add-ons allow to develop courses with more interactive and thus eye-catching elements. Before they can be used, they need to be installed on the server-side, which affects the LMS user interface and requires enough user permissions. On the other it exists a standard for Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), that allows to link content or apply services from so-called LTI provider to a LMS course, see [Se10]. This content is integrated via an iframe and authentication is handled in the background.\nIn contrast to this, every LiaScript course can define its own “extensions” as macros, as it was briefly introduced in Sec. 2.1. These macros can be shared among different courses, either by copy and pasting the source-code directly into the main-header of the LiaScript document or by using the following directive (also within the main-header):\nimport: https://raw-course-url.md\nIf a course is hosted on Github, it is possible to reference to any desired version, as it was highlighted within the previous section. All required macros, JavaScript libraries, CSS style-sheets, will automatically be loaded at the initialization. See also the template-index (https://github.com/liaTemplates), which provides a list of self-documenting macros, ranging from 360 degree imaging, computer algebra, visualization, up to online programming in various languages.\n5 Discussion LMSs are more about recording users and generating scores and reports to measure their progress. This becomes even more obvious, if you search for Add-ons and extensions for your LMS2. Only a minority is dealing with content and the integration of new interactive elements. Thus, even if someone is willing to create online courses this way, the majority of GUI elements with too many settings and required clicks and page switches seem to be more daunting than useful. Learning and understanding all of these concepts (and every plugin probably posses its own user logic) before being able to add some content, seems to be simply wrong. That is why we believe that LMS are not only used to restrict the access to educational resources, but also restrict their creation.\nLiaScript was developed from an opposite perspective, by focusing on content first through the usage of a simple but yet extendable DSL. This allows to treat courses similar to open-source projects, which can be shared and developed accordingly even by larger developer groups. Since in teaching there is no single source of truth, there can also exist multiple versions of the same course. In open-source terminology that means: a teacher could simply “fork” an existing course and modify or translate it into another language and “push” the changes back or proceed with his own course. Due to discussions with students, the course can be continuously improved by “committing” new versions, while older ones are still accessible, or by creating “branches” for different groups of students. This might sound odd for a non-programmer, but makes totally sense for every programmer3.\nAdditionally, even without an online interpreter, the LiaScript remains readable and editable as a text document. One of the key-challenges of LiaScript was to overcome this segregation of learning materials into textbooks, PowerPoint presentations, and videos. By using this DSL, the user can decide what is her/his favorite mode and switch between.\nBibliography [Ca14]\tCavus, N., Zabadi, T.: A Comparison Of Open Source Learning Management Systems.

So the idea was born to create a DSL that is based on Markdown but intended to be used for developing online courses, that look like screen-cast with various interactive elements. Starting this project with Elm, it was more or less an explorative journey, with rapid changes in the DSL and the interpreter that were guided by the Elm-compiler. Code-blocks are now executable and editable, quizzes can be defined in various ways, images are generated from ASCII-art, effects and transitions combined with text2speech that enable interactive storytelling, among other features. But the course itself is still a valid Markdown document that can be edited by any ordinary person, even without programming skills. The interpreter build around the Elm-architecture hides all complexity, such as code evaluation, internal message routing, lazy parsing, etc.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/liascript-a-domain-specific-language-for-interactive-online-courses/","title":"LiaScript: a domain-specific-language for interactive online courses","description":"Interactive conference paper for the eLearning 2019 conference in Porto","date":"September 19, 2019","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/mccsis_hu532596500064099037.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"203\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/mccsis_hu1757518383188085346.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/post/mccsis_hu5931162314095953573.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/post\\/mccsis_hu16109681425471000189.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Article, Conference","tags":"LiaScript, Publication","content":"This is the first paper published about LiaScript, which was presented at the International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) International Conference on e-Learning 2019 in Porto. It gives an overview of the language and its features, as well as the motivation behind its development.\nAbstract. LiaScript is an attempt to enable everyone to create free and interactive online courses, without the need of being an experienced programmer. Instead, it aims to bring both parties, software-and course-developers, closer together by introducing Open-Source techniques into the Open-courSe development process. LiaScript was designed to be compatible to Common-Markdown, but it introduces lots of language extensions that deal with quizzes, surveys, ASCII-art, text2speech, animations, online programming, the integration of JavaScript, etc. as well as its own macro-system that simplifies tedious and repetitive tasks. It comes along with its own just-in-time compiler that runs in the browser and therefor does not require additional tooling.\ndownload / liascript / github\nbibtex @InProceedings{dietrich2019, author = {Andr\\\u0026#39;e Dietrich}, title = {LiaScript: a domain-specific-language for interactive online courses}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning 2019}, year = {2019}, pages = {186--194}, address = {Porto, Portugal} } The video recording below was made at the 7th of April in 2024.

Over the years, LiaScript has undergone significant evolution, yet the foundational principles, key concepts, and the syntax have steadfastly remained unchanged. We made a minor but crucial modification in our approach to embedding videos; we shifted from using the !! link syntax to !?. This change was implemented to avoid confusion with other markdown interpreters and platforms like GitHub, ensuring our examples remain accessible and functional. These examples continue to serve as valuable resources for those looking to craft their own courses.\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to underline that the essence of our content lies within a single, interpretable text file, processed by a browser-based application. This unique approach allows for continuous improvement of the application\u0026rsquo;s user experience while simultaneously empowering educators to refine and update course content. Our decision to focus on a browser-app over developing a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle has proven to be a strategic choice. It has enabled us to avoid the pitfalls of quickly outdated course materials, offering a dynamic and flexible learning environment that stands the test of time.\nFor more insights into LiaScript and to start creating your own open-source MOOCs, explore the documentation available at:\nLiaScript 0.14 - Full Documentation (English) This is a screencast of the LiaScript documentation in presentation mode spoken by LiaScript itself ;-) You can inspect the document by your own, either directly from GitHub or as the interactive LiaScript version. 0.
