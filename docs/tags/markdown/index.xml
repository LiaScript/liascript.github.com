So the idea was born to create a DSL that is based on Markdown but intended to be used for developing online courses, that look like screen-cast with various interactive elements. Starting this project with Elm, it was more or less an explorative journey, with rapid changes in the DSL and the interpreter that were guided by the Elm-compiler.</description></item></channel></rss>
