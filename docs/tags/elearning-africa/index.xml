This workshop will demonstrate how LiaScript can be used to create sustainable and extendable open educational resources (OER) that are interactive, engaging, and even work offline. In contrast to complex user-interfaces and memorising lots of point and click events, participants will work with simple text-files only.
LiaScript is based on Markdown, which is founded on ideas around simplicity, adaptability and extendibility.</description></item><item><title>Invitation to eLearning Africa 23</title><link>https://LiaScript.github.io/blog/invitation-to-elearning-africa-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://LiaScript.github.io/blog/invitation-to-elearning-africa-2023/</guid><description>We will have a full-day workshop at the eLearning Africa conference in Dakar on creating free and open interactive courses with LiaScript Markdown &amp;hellip;
