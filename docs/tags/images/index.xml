If you prefix a link in Markdown with an exclamation mark, then this link is marked as an image, and it gets embedded into the document. LiaScript had already two extensions for this, the question-mark is used to indicate audio (just think of an ear) and images with sound which are used as markers for video content.
![image](url) ?[audio](url) !?[video](url) One benefit of using this notation is, that this does not interfere with Markdown, the link is still valid and &amp;ldquo;clickable&amp;rdquo; in any other Markdown-viewer.</description></item></channel></rss>
