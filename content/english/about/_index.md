LiaScript began with a simple frustration: while online learning keeps growing, most MOOCs and tutorials remain closed, static, and expensive to produce. They are difficult to update, rarely available as OER, and often designed only for large English-speaking audiences. A single recorded mistake can live forever.

I wanted a different kind of educational ecosystem — one that works the way open-source software works: collaborative, adaptable, forkable, and accessible to everyone.

That idea became LiaScript.

LiaScript is an open, Markdown-based language and interpreter that turns plain text into fully interactive courses — quizzes, simulations, animations, code execution, TTS, and much more — directly in the browser, even offline.  
No proprietary platforms. No complex build steps. No lock-in.

Our mission:

**Make high-quality, open education easy to create and impossible to close.**

With LiaScript, courses behave like open-source projects.  
They can be versioned, translated, remixed, and improved by communities, educators, and institutions. Whether you’re teaching a major university lecture or creating a small course for a niche audience — even something like cuneiform writing for 8th-graders in Swahili — LiaScript enables it.

As in *Ratatouille*:  
**“Anyone can cook.”**  
With LiaScript, the belief is similar:  
**“Anyone can share knowledge.”**

The project is fully open-source and developed in public on GitHub:

Education should not be a gated business of paywalls, exclusive institutions, and static materials.  
It should be open, adaptable, collaborative — and shared freely with the world.
