I am a huge fan of online-courses (MOOCs), tutorials, YouTube-courses, podcasts, etc., BUT ... MOOCs are not in the public domain (although they should be), produced expensively by publishers, which are interested in user numbers and therefore only produce general courses for a large English speaking audience. Video and audio recordings are also hard to produce, they are “static” and one mistake or a missing fact cannot be fixed that easy.

That is why I started to develop LiaScript, as a simple and extendable Markdown-dialect that allows sharing knowledge by creating interactive courses in an Open-Source manner, where anyone can participate and contribute. Even if it is a course for a minor audience, such as teaching cuneiform writing to 8-graders in Swahili.

... and most of all, I hate the fact that education is still a business with private schools and universities, expensive BOOKS and MOOCS...
