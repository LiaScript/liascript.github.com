Additionally, we plan to be online earlier to remind you, if necessary. Looking forward to seeing you there!


## Program:

Here's a sneak peek at our program: we currently have four user stories ranging from the creation of courses with AI assistance, managing larger authoring teams, to utilizing collaborative classrooms.

- Warm up
- 5 years of LiaScript - Lessons learned
- 4 User stories
- Open Discussion, Feedback, ...
- State of LiaScript

  - Improving the Editor
  - Sharing courses (the new ways)
  - Scripts hidden (interactive) Gems
  - Classrooms extensions (& Lab-Sharing)

- Future Work

## The Past

With LiaScript, we initially aimed to elevate the creation of OER content to the level of open-source projects, with easy hosting and collaborative authoring teams. We will provide an overview of the past five years and the lessons learned from this journey.
The Present

Our current focus has been on connecting users, creating interactive educational content, and minimizing barriers. We will briefly introduce the latest editor features designed to simplify collaborative creation and distribution of courses. For those unfamiliar, we'll demonstrate the use of classrooms and reveal a hidden gem: how to create dynamic and always up-to-date content with LiaScript scripts.
The Future

Our recent research has been characterized by remote labs - hardware setups accessible and controllable over the internet. We've realized that the concepts of decentralized classrooms, as we experiment with in LiaScript, can be applied to remote labs as well. Conversely, concepts and ideas gleaned from working with remote labs can now be integrated into LiaScript. While LiaScript already allows for creating custom extensions, we will showcase how these can be applied to classrooms too, enabling any conceivable form of collaboration or cooperation within LiaScript classrooms.

We are eagerly looking forward to it and hope you are too!
