> Markdown is an ideal tool for documenting and thus a suitable format for Open Educational Resources, but as a static markup language it is also boring.
> So the idea was born to create a DSL that is based on Markdown but intended to be used for developing online courses, that look like screen-cast with various interactive elements.
> Starting this project with Elm, it was more or less an explorative journey, with rapid changes in the DSL and the interpreter that were guided by the Elm-compiler.
> Code-blocks are now executable and editable, quizzes can be defined in various ways, images are generated from ASCII-art, effects and transitions combined with text2speech that enable interactive storytelling, among other features.
> But the course itself is still a valid Markdown document that can be edited by any ordinary person, even without programming skills.
> The interpreter build around the Elm-architecture hides all complexity, such as code evaluation, internal message routing, lazy parsing, etc.
