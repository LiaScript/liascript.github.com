Watch a live coding session where we build interactive online courses using LiaScript, supercharged with AI assistance. This video—recorded during the Expert Meeting on AI and TVET 2025—offers an inside look at how modern tools and automation are reshaping technical and vocational education. Follow along with the source code on GitHub and explore event details on the Fraunhofer IFF website.

### LiaScript: Hello World

In the following video LiaScript says "Hello" and introduces itself by using media comments. However this is only one representation from which you can choose. The narrator and voice were generated with [Heygen.ai](https://www.heygen.com/). If you want to find out more about media comments, check out the following blog post:
