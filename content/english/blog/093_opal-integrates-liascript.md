We're thrilled to announce that **OPAL** (Online-Plattform für Akademisches Lehren und Lernen), the primary Learning Management System serving 21 Saxon universities with over 80,000 users and approximately 35,000 online courses, now natively supports LiaScript! As of July 2, 2025, educators at institutions including TU Dresden, TU Chemnitz, TU Bergakademie Freiberg, and the University of Leipzig can directly upload and render LiaScript Markdown files within their courses - no SCORM exports, no complex workarounds, just pure Markdown. This collaborative achievement between **TU Chemnitz**, **TU Bergakademie Freiberg**, and **BPS Bildungsportal Sachsen GmbH** opens the full power of interactive quizzes, text-to-speech, live code execution, and multimedia integration to Saxon higher education.

For educators, getting started is remarkably simple: create your content in the [LiaScript LiveEditor](https://liascript.github.io/LiveEditor/), download the Markdown file, upload it to OPAL's "Einzelne Seite" component, and watch it render automatically with full interactivity. This integration validates LiaScript's philosophy that interactive, engaging educational content should be as simple as writing structured text with a typewriter ... in an open format, decentralized content, and accessible tools can thrive within institutional frameworks.

This milestone represents institutional validation at scale: when a system serving tens of thousands of users across 21 institutions natively supports your format, it's a powerful endorsement of simplicity and openness in education. We're excited to see how Saxon educators will leverage this integration to create, share, and transform how we teach and learn.
