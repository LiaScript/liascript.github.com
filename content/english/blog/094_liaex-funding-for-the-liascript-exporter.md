We are thrilled to announce that our **LiaScript-Exporter**, now developed under the name **LiaEx**, has received funding through the [OE_Sprints](https://www.oer-strategie.de/foerdern/foerderrichtlinien/oe_sprints/) program of the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMBFSFJ)! 🎉

### The Project: LiaEx – OER Exporter for LiaScript

**Project Period:** October 15, 2025 – April 14, 2026
**Funding Code:** 01PZ25002
**Funding Amount:** €50,000

LiaEx was selected during a national OER pitch event and contributes to the German Federal OER Strategy. The project focuses on improving access, interoperability, and openness in digital education through exportable, reusable, and standards-based learning content.

### About OE_Sprints

**OE_Sprints** is a short-term funding program supporting innovative, needs-based developments in the OER ecosystem. Projects are implemented in an agile and collaborative manner to quickly close infrastructural gaps and strengthen open educational practices.

Its main goals include:

* Supporting open and interoperable infrastructures
* Promoting inclusive and accessible learning solutions
* Encouraging collaboration and community-driven innovation
* Reducing technical and organizational barriers

### What LiaEx Will Deliver

LiaEx will enhance the existing LiaScript-Exporter into a versatile tool that allows educational content created with LiaScript to be used across different **Learning Management Systems (LMS)** and **open educational formats**.

A key goal is to enable seamless export and integration of LiaScript courses into systems such as **Moodle**, **ILIAS**, and **OpenOLAT**, as well as conversion into **H5P** packages.

#### Project Focus Areas

* **Interoperability** – Connecting LiaScript with major LMS platforms
* **Learning Infrastructure** – Expanding OER-friendly ecosystems
* **Open Standards** – Supporting SCORM, xAPI, H5P, and IMS
* **Accessibility** – Lowering technical barriers for educators and learners
* **Open Source Development** – Transparent and collaborative improvement

#### Planned Improvements

1. **Extended Export Options**
   Expansion of the export functionalities to support multiple e-learning standards and output formats.

2. **User-Friendly Applications**
   Development of both a **desktop** and a **web-based** version of the exporter for easy use without technical setup.

3. **Open & Sustainable Development**
   Continued open-source development with community input, documentation, and integration of open standards to ensure long-term usability and adaptability.

### Why It Matters

#### Reducing Barriers

Many educators already rely on existing learning management systems. LiaEx enables them to integrate LiaScript-based materials directly into these systems, preserving the interactive benefits of LiaScript while increasing reach and flexibility.

#### Supporting All Sectors

By supporting open standards, LiaEx enables the use of interactive courses across educational levels — from schools and universities to vocational training and lifelong learning.

#### Community Collaboration

LiaEx is developed **for and with** the community. Educators, developers, and OER advocates are invited to contribute ideas, code, and feedback. This collaborative approach ensures transparency, adaptability, and long-term sustainability.

### Outlook

Over the course of the project, the LiaEx team will:

1. Design the **H5P conversion bridge**
2. Develop **desktop and web interfaces** for broader accessibility
3. Conduct **testing and community feedback rounds**
4. Release the final version as an **open-source tool AGAIN**

### Get Involved

The success of LiaEx depends on community participation!
Educators, developers, and OER enthusiasts are invited to test, contribute, and help shape the future of the project.
