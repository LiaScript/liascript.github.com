This is an automated translation of the [LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io) LiaScript into the Korean language.

You can inspect the document by your own, either directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/liaScript/docs) or as the interactive [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md) version.
